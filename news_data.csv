Please!  I'm begging you!  Quit confusing religious groups, and stop
making generalizations!  I'm a Protestant!  I'm an evangelical!  I don't
believe that my way is the only way!  I'm not a ""creation scientist""!  I
don't think that homosexuals should be hung by their toenails!  

If you want to discuss bible thumpers, you would be better off singling
out (and making obtuse generalizations about) Fundamentalists.  If you
compared the actions of Presbyterians or Methodists with those of Southern 
Baptists, you would think that they were different religions!

Please, prejudice is about thinking that all people of a group are the
same, so please don't write off all Protestants or all evangelicals!

(Pleading mode off.)

God.......I wish I could get ahold of all the Thomas Stories......

Hey, man, you brought it up.  I agree completely, driving drunk is really
stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But
DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as 
motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the
insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly.

In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue,
but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto,
admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.

<8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?

  Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites
  is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who
  has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment. 
  Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses 
  (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.
 
  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk
  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):
  pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX
  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to
  aid remailer use).

  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu
  -----------------------------
    Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.
    
  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu
  -------------------------
    Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus
    <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.  Request
    information from that address.
    
  hal@alumni.caltech.edu
  ----------------------
    Experimental remailer with encryption to server and return
    addresses.  Request information from above address.

  hh@soda.berkeley.edu
  hh@cicada.berkeley.edu
  hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu
  ----------------------
    Experimental remailer.  Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.

  nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu 
  ----------------------
    Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by
    Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.

  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu 
  -----------------------------
    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site
    address for information.

  Notes
  =====
  
  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often
    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues
    are wholly unresolved.
  
  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP
    software (see the question on cryptography). 

  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)
    vary between sites.

  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are
    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.

_____
<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?

  
  Users
  -----

  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the
    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.
  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.
  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on
    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.
  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.
    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases
    network traffic.
  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this
    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'
    hierarchy is preferred.
  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.
    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for
    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any
    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even
    future ones under the same handle.
  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your
    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by
    sending anonymized mail to yourself.
  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. 
    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.
  - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.
  - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.
    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.
  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large
    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating
    his hardware, all for your convenience.

  Operators
  ---------

  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an
    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and
    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and
    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and
    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or
    lassaiz-faire?
  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate
    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user
    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user
    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your
    users trust you to protect them.
  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations
    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.
    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke
    the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)
  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.
    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly
    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with
    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under
    ``(in)stability of anonymity''.
  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?
    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is
    your commitment to it?
  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an
    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. 
    Consult a lawyer about your liability.
  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared
    to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you
    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system
    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.
  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If
    possible, query group readers.
  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message
    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure
    the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.
  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from
    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.

  Readers
  -------
  
  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason
    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that
    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail
    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its
    volume is heavy or increasing).
  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters
    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate
    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.
  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,
    harassment, extortion, etc.
  - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they
    offend you personally.
  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the
    idea of anonymity itself.
  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings
    should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or
    `conceivable' need exists.

<8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?

  James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:

  > Try putting this in your kill file:
  >   
  >   /Anon/h:j
  >   /Anonymous/h:j
  > 
  > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that
  > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't
  > kill followups. 
  
  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask
  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so
  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common
  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.

<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?

  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for
  individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is
  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion
  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack
  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was
  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)
  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided
  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up
  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous
  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through
  servers like there's no tomorrow.''
  
  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in
  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste
  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system
  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the
  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,
  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by
  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended
  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group
  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was
  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' 
  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an
  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus
  against it. 

  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to
  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and
  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of
  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his
  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to
  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the
  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was
  created.''

  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most
  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on
  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized
  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine
  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide
  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.
  
  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet
  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological
  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).
  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,
  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than
  ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of
  anonymity is also controversial.

  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb
  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate
  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via
  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been
  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then
  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a
  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of
  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating
  through many newsgroups. 
  
  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded
  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''
  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was
  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of
  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived
  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries
  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous
  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his
  detractors.

  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal
  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news
  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire
  extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the
  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is
  best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users
  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a
  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized
  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due
  to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to
  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.

  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to
  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste
  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate
  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages
  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to
  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several
  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it
  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5
  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the
  service's administration. In response to the serious threats he
  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and
  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.
  
  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by
  ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security
  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is
  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is
  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon
  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new
  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple
  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,
  etc.

  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.
  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography
  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of
  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public
  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several
  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately
  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the
  software to the public domain.

  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on
  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and
  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the
  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,
  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable
  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in
  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to
  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing
  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and
  encryption.

  is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document.

Top Ten Ways Slick Willie Could Improve His Standing With Americans



10. Institute a national sales tax to pay for the socialization of
    America's health care resources.

9.  Declare war on Serbia. Reenact the draft.

8.  Stimulate the economy with massive income transfers to Democtratic
    constituencies.

7.  Appoint an unrepetent socialist like Mario Cuomo to the Suprmeme Court.

6.  Focus like a laser beam on gays in the military.

5.  Put Hillary in charge of the Ministry of Truth and move Stephanopoulos
    over to socialzed health care.

4.  Balance the budget through confiscatory taxation.

3.  Remind everyone, again, how despite the Democrats holding the
    Presidency, the majority of seats in the House, and in the Senate,
    the Republicans have still managed to block his tax-and-spend programs.

2.  Go back to England and get a refresher course in European Socialism.

1.  Resign, now!

-*----
I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a
definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly
and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition
is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids
mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous
work.  Lee Lady writes:

> I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some

Unless one classifies ""thinking and informal exploration"" as a
mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would
consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as
unscientific.  

In article <C5nAsF.MH7@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes:

Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not
clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be
taken as describing what ""science is mainly about.""  Consider,
for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking
a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and
what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what
invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and
still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,
that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that
some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are
ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the
definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are
""mainly about.""

The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient
context for people to understand my proposed definition.

I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only
take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians
that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  

As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about
""absolute scientific truth.""  I think it is more useful to talk
about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the
kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have
proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of
degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the
relevance of different kinds of evidence.  

One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as
psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion
regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,
the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the
historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence
are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to
speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that
speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to
identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence
was presently available for them, and to describe how research
could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to
uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper
of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the
author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It
is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)

I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --
deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When
proponents of some practice see no value in more careful
investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many
researchers' minds.  

This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some
intersection between things that are worth investigating and
things that are advocated by those who seem careless or
unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can
understand why many scientists would just as soon select other
directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one
wants to become this generation's Rhine.

I think this is absurd.

I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,
dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are
submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for
publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly
eases one's defense.)

Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either
on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little
about either and so have nothing to offer.

Not to mention that the story was rewritten today. Those two BD's who

Today, ""a few saw someone starting a fire"" and ""our aerial surveillance

What you're saying is, in effect, ""I think some things are repulsive,

should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever, period"".

      Which in and of itself is nice enough; to some extent I agree with
you. But I do _not_ agree that things are 'inherently' or 'absolutely'
immoral; they are labeled 'immoral' each for its own good reason, and if
the reason can even theoretically change, then so can the label.

      No it doesn't. Humans are to some extent similar, because we all
belong to the same species; that that species has evolved is another
story altogether. To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence
to moral absolutism (of a flavour).

It is, I think, up to a point; but societies are not all alike, and
neither are their moralities.

      No, it's falsifiable through finding someoe who was ""created

Define ""armed better"". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the
Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which
faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other
guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson
in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to
3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops
like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something
often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).

A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.

- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull
  the trigger again.
- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,
  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.
- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again
  to rotate to the next round.
- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the
  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an
  easy motion, even one handed.
- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines
  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.

- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell
  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often
  lost as you realize ""hey, it's jammed!"" before starting to do anything
  about clearing it.
- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round
  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the 
  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider
  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed
  of employment as a revolver.
- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of
  operation of many of them requires more training.

Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly
switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having
accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks
require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex
as the timer on a VCR.

Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun
the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter
and pay attention. I do not seek here to say ""semi-autos are junk""
merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop
with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than
equipped for anything short of a riot.

Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a 
wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.
Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.
I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon
to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit
what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously
wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those
extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in
criminal encounters is less than 5.

What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple
.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police 
prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....

ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they 
        introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking
        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.

Most of Scotty's followup *was* irrelevant to the original question,
but this is not unusual, as threads often quickly evolve away from
the original topic.  What I could not understand is why Jim spent so
much time responding to what he regarded as irrelevancies.

I understand what you mean by ""collective,"" but I think it is an

The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI:
SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer 
base.
SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides
 SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers.
SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, 
and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be
wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support
fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the
Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses
TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a
lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}

From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out
as for ""20% faster then IDE"" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 
contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1
and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a
normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near
the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.

The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 
controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device
{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs
IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the ""20%
faster then IDE"" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it
was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with
SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device
with a SCSI-2 controller chip.
SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips
{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit
mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips
{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH
worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware
(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates
a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.

When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the
article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the
figures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out
ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with
SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }

It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the
tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.
As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was
more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin
for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)
Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with
a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition
because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science
discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that
Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.

Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She 
refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old 
would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed
to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.

RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that
being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.

Now you are letting an omniscient being give information to me.  This

Which type of morality are you talking about?  In a natural sense, it
is not at all immoral to harm another species (as long as it doesn't

:) No...I was one of the lucky ones. Very little acne as a teenager. I
didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it
really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. 

Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp
thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under
the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day
vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  
is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be
where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease 
on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating
meat).

Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm
water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will
help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it
softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with
oilyness. 

Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with
a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any
prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of
pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't
be an infection afterwards.

Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry
makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an
incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).

Hello netters!

I'm visiting the US (I'm from Sweden) in August. I will probably rent a Chevy
Beretta from Alamo. I've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days. 
This would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (Baltimore). 
They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but I doubt that,
 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
insurance than what's included in the base price. But on the other hand he didn't
rent it from Alamo.

Does anyone have some info on this?

Is $225 a rip-off? 
Probability that I'll be needing more insurance?
Is the beretta a good rental car?

Thanx

This is a common misconception.  There was nothing ""off the wall""
about the Wright Brothers.  They were in correspondance with a number
of other experimenters (Octave Chanute, Lillienthal, etc), they flew
models, they had a wind tunnel.  In short, they were quite mainstream
and were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community.

I suggest you read The Bishop's Boys or the biography by Harry Gates?
Combs?  (I can never remember which it is--the guy that had the FBOs
and owned Learjet for a while).  These are both in print and easily
obtainable.  The Bishop's Boys is in trade paperback, even.

Even better would be the multi-volume set of the Wrights' writings,
but this is out of print, rare, and hideously expensive.

Hello,

you're not quite sure if that's a joke or not? Anyway you read the article!

--> You're right!!!

(1. The header (only this) IS a joke, 2. it's worth reading)

Perhaps some of you know my regular 'List of IDE Harddisk specs' where I
give all available information about IDE Harddrives. I am strongly
interested in contacting the manufacturers directly. But I have no money
for overseas calls, so I need

	HARDDISK MANUFACTURER's  EMAIL ADDRESSES

Please help if you can!

Carsten.

Then you shouldn't've done it. Try answering the damn question.
I am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the SC
in there.

Well, my point was that the SC and the SHO both have very similar
characteristics (front and rear disks (ABS on the SHO?), high output
V6, 4-wheel independent suspension, very good aerodynamics, 3-point
harness, fat rubber, and 130mph+ top speed). If one of them is 
up to standard (and I think the SC is), but the other isn't, then
why is that? No flamage, just curiousity.

  Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were
tanks
  used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired
their
  main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is
  ludicrous.

Awesley replied:
     I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,
  supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.

The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It
has been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that
tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress
sniper fire and that they were ""quite"" effective at this.  You continue to
back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is
disputing.

Awesley went on:
  I
  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was
  down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10
  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's
  Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of
  Tonia Blanding, age 4.
   
        ""When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction
  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the
  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front
  of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out
  of the side of the apartment.""
  
       Well, it's not the main gun.  

""Well, it's not the main gun.""  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you
now going to admit that you were wrong?

I wrote:
  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main
  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I
read
  the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. 
  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard
  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American
  cities in the Sixties.

Awesley replied:
    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to
  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main
  guns.

I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67
riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place
without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American
military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have
been *big* news.

Awesley goes on:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

And on:
  I don't
  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and
actually
  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know
  what you find.

I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used
F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you
believe me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research
it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?

If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been
screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about
it.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. 
If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer
to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that
those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.

Well, I gotta tell ya,

last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU!
It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the
Don and Ron it was the an ""off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils 
were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....

IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His
fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he
created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the
credit away from Gilmour).

I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? 
Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet,
Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs
fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well
so far??

Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence,
moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost
at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.
(BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't 
remember him having any as of yet.)

Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris
has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and
Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last
against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to
see this one?)

Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!
Go LEAFS Go!!!!

   It depends on the attack.  Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of
work to be done in a straight brute-force attack, where you try every single
possible key until one works.  Processing and storage requirements for this
kind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively
impossible.  However, there may be other attacks whose difficulty is (for
example) proportional to, say, 2**sqrt(n), or some such.  Also, a long
key does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little
of the key at a time....

I hope I didn't award custody, Rich.  I purposely used ""handle"" in order to 
avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are
aberrations like ""scientific"" creationism).  I used ""best"" in part to indicate 
that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are
mostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the
matter.  As an aside, for science I should have written ""how and when"".  Nobody
seems to argue over what.

>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the ""who and 
>why"" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or 
>agnostics.

Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not
trying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.
On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which
you know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological
perspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I 
think the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are 
incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to 
be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore 
it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for 
dispensing answers to ""who and why"".  I suggest that this holds regardless of 
the ""truth"" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  
In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as ""real"" as scientific facts and 
explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  

>Do you suggest that the ""who and why"" will forever be closed to scientific 
>investigation?

No.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. 
Isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was 
created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might 
presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued 
that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't
have to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for
people today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not 
explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, 
I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific 
as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but 
I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will 
be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty 
convoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  

>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on
>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.

I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, 
when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, 
reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, 
and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the 
naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely 
leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and
the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.

True, coach Matikainen is ready to keep a spot for Teemu all the way

them the spots cannot be left open for too long. Esa Tikkanen we have
already.

There are a lot of people running around saying ""God told me this"" and 
""God told me that"" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others
heard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He
said someone told him, ""The Lord gave me a song.""  He said that it was
the worst song he had ever heard.

""I know why he gave you that song,"" Murillo said, ""He didn't want it anymore.""

But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the
idea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit
in the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first
to put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one
we have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  

Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.
For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an ""M"" who
prophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy
he gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies
because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, ""He never prophesies
anything good about me.""  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his 
lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.
Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an 
apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of
Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet
before he gave them.  

So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it 
Scripture.  

>Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new
>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call
>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with
>knowledge?

I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with 
prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also 
similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies
in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, ""And his bishoprick let another
take"" concerning Judas office.

A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about
what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel
about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural
prophecy can be used in later prophecy.  

Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,
but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom
can overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  
Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often
considered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a 
bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to
label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the 
Spirit, and use them according to His leading.

My point is that you set up your views as the only way to believe.  Saying 
that all eveil in this world is caused by atheism is ridiculous and 
counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups.  I see in your posts a 
spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don'

The 1941 Lincoln Continental was the first car to sport the ""continental
kit."" The continental kit is not to be confused with ye olde outside

There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas
Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a
professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy ""you're not in
Kansas anymore"" Denning).  The article was titled ""Government slowly
eroding our liberties"", and in it he tells a story attributed to the
late Leonard Read who

        explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from
        Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read
        said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and
        then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that
        as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.
        You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it
        up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being
        cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.
        If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we
        would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as
        with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken
        a little bit at a time.

The last line of the article says, ""It's not too late for us, but the
water is getting pretty warm.""  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the
Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.

I would hope so.  Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon
whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic
nuclei.  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses 
in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause 
death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of
people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or
cropland.  


Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous
gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there
is no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for
research purposes on such chemicals.

I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for 
definitions.

It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  Many things are
banned for other reasons.

All the more need for end-to-end encryption schemes that bypass the

This could be accomplished by other criteria.  One must remember
that children often bring stress into households. As an alternative,
one could consider financial incentives for every sexual act performed
by two partners of different ethnic backgrounds.  The plan could
be entitled ""PEACE INCOME SEXUAL SECURITY"", or PISS for short.

Every time an Israeli gets screwed
by a Palestinian or visa versa, they would be eligible for income.
In keeping with the spirit of the times, condoms would be a tax deductible
expense.  This policy does not discriminate on a gender basis nor
would it apply to domestic animals of either nationality.

Joint Palestinan-Israeli teams would be obligated to ensure that all
acts were voluntary and promptly rewarded. The teams of Palestinian-Israel
Morals Patrols, or PIMPS, would receive a percentage of the financial
income in order to encourage their participation and add to their
incentive in locating suitable candidates.

Hi,

My name is rahul and I am doing MS at USU, Logan
My query is:
	I have a HP workstation: HP Series 400 with X running on it.
I have a true color - 24bit color monitor connected to this machine.
Normally I have the capability to display 256 colors from a max of
16.7 million. Since the monitor is True Color I can see 16.7
million at a time. 
Que: do we have a facility in X(c-function call) that will enable me
to specify any RGB combination and see it on screen? I am using
XStoreColor to set the pallette of a max of 256 colors.
Que: If not. Is there any way I can display a true color image
on a true color monitor using XLib function calls?

We are generating ray traced images and 256 colors are indeed a
painful limit. besides I need the facility to display the true color images 
i will be generating on a true color system WITHOUT color 
quantification.
Please, if anyone can help i'd be obliged

COD is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 150.00
for a brick. Or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used
on a COD it's fine till a stop payment is made. There are few methods
to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction. Even with
merchants and customers there are problems...stolen credit cards, 
chargebacks, no return policies and getting the wrong item, etc.

About the only protection available to to do business with someone you

Programmatically, yes, we can land an Orbiter with a 5 cm hole in
the wall -- provided that the thing which caused 5 cm hole didn't
cause a Crit 1 failure on some of the internal systems.  There are
a few places where a 5 cm hole would cause a Bad Day -- especially
if the 5 cm hole went all the way through the Orbiter and out the

I finished reading a very good book, ""The Will of God"", Weatherhead.
This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the
will of God.

Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts;
intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He
(Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael
Parkin above quite nicely.

Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will
is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with,
even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by
circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all
humankind) will never be stopped.

Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of
this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's
intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life
and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and
deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3)
Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the
Cross, as Jesus willingly (""not my will, Lord, but yours"") died for
the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant,
overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.

It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial
will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.

  I question the implications of this statement; namely, that there are certain
physical acts which are limited to God and that attempting to replicate these
acts is blasphemy against God.  God caused a bush to burn without being
consumed--if I do the same thing, am I usurping God's role?  
  Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically
removing the physical ""proofs"" of God's existence.  As time goes on we have to
rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase
science is removing our props.  I don't think this is a bad thing.

    Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think
we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is
no ""option"" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:
there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full
'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).
And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other
than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one
of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be
getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't
be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.
It's not an ""option.""
    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s
thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot
recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for
a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or
something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to
replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not
need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the
full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.

  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.  This
Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yet
because he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, you
attack him.  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's
question in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The only
ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact
are the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having some
INTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race!
{assuming you are also semitic}
	Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -
off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of
Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they
massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing
to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their
very lives.
	I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part
Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the
Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the
Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for
German and European anti semitism.

one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that ""child abuse"",

Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat
shaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three
picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning
and blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).

Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leading
hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young
and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.

  Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant

of RBI's; and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive

Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand
what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the 
meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will
come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere 
belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your 
belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this 
is what James means when he says that ""faith without works is dead"" 
and, ""I will show you my faith by my works.""  Remember James was 
writing to ""the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.""  This 
probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much 
later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.
(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he
intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the
people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of
the Greek.

Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's
statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul
contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the
gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great
burden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go
convert a bunch of people, then the ""Judizers"" would come along and
try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf
Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being
saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood
of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation
for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think
""faithfulness"" today has a meaning closer to what the original
writers intended.

>Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
>and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.

I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is
that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not ""keep kosher"" to a
kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters
of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.

>But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to
>him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who
>knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.

In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and 
be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are 
worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in
the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in
the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that
the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.

[I agree with you in general, including the fact that ""pistis"" has
some of the force of ""faithful"".  However if you take that too far,
you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have
intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say
that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we
are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.

I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that
completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd
call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and
commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic
change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show
the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any
Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that
Jesus calls being born again.

An other post described it as like a ""microwaved Tootsie Roll"" --

Is there any doubt that this is true?  After a few down years, the A.L. East
is back to where it was in the early eighties.  With the emergence of the O's
and the Yanks, it is far and away the best.  While the N.L. West has the best
team in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else.  The
Giants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf
teams that are found in the A.L. East.  And the Dodgers just plain suck.  As
for the Rockies, who knows?
   The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to
free agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball.  The Orioles have
the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never
forget about Ripken.  The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't
hurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken.  While they let a
lot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam
Horn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team
intact.

My predicted finish:
1. Baltimore (Could be a biased opinion)
2. NY Yankees
3. Toronto
4. Milwaukee
5. Detroit
6. Boston
7. Cleveland (Would have been higher if not for the accident)

In the April edition of ""One Small Step for a Space Activist"",
Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:
  ""Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes
   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like
   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the
   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts
   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the
   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to
   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about
   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10
   billion won't be spent on anything having anything
   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion
   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done
   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting
   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the
   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the
   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are
   getting and the price they are paying and note that
   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware
   that a third of the money is going for something else.""

My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple
of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I
talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station
at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a
response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed
to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz
data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low
on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend
in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers 
Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF
to 15,000 science teachers.]

First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does
exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'
for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.
This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4
center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at
$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is
04/2.2 = 1.8%

Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30
billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to
$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I
will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket
change.

I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could
be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds
that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some
states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat
the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it
take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds
we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*
subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in
front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds
go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax
rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the
center, and not to the prime contracts.

This leads to the obvious question ""What is the government
doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?
(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A
big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens
to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten
up by the center tax?)""

At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting
development funds (as they are supporting the development
work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to
setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical
power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life
solar array field (left over from solar cell research
research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries
(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC
switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated
loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent
change evaluation involving concerns about the stability
of the power system.

We have also used the supporting development money to
purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life
testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in
Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on
test recently hit the four year life test milestone.
38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the
on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).

As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used
the supporting development funds to purchase personal
computers and work stations, for performing system
analyses (like modeling of the performance of the
electrical power system, availability calculations
using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a 
database with information on weight of the power
system elements).

Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all
go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director
does control a small discretionary fund. Each year,
any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to
the director to get money from this fund to look
at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.

Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'
services at the Center, like the library, the 
central computer services division, the Contractor 
who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather
difficult to determine what percentage of the
SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get
an accurate figure, you would have to take
the annual expenditure for the library (for example),
and then divide by the amount of the library funds
used to support SSF (which would be hard to
compute by itself - how would you figure out
what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for
1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on
the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week
versus the rest of the center personnel). You would
then have to compare this estimate of the SSF
portion of the library expense with the portion of
the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,
maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but
we underpay for snow removal? Talk about
a burecratic nightmare!

My last point is that I can't believe your claim that
Congress has never heard of the term 'center tax.'
Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before
Congress isn't on a computer, so I can't do a simple
word search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,
in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods
were documented for Congress?

Summary: Need help!!!

One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...

For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply
to the following specs:

Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V
Current:   *limited* at 1A

Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A
AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)

Of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting
regulator chip ;^)

Our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to
do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do,
if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the
supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal
one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we
should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm 
resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by
necessity, must be 1V.

The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves
a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output 
power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.

So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?

Thanks in advance.

	Uh oh...
	Umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes.  Some involve
modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.
	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
been successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of new
ways to ""crack"" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact
is, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or
less difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.
	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not
impossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good
one for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying
to crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,
assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,
legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of
files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy
protected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas for
practical applications, and are merely curious?
	Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I
can.

	Incidentally, the ""Uh oh..."" at the top is indicative of the dread
anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels
when they are asked how to hack.  The area you are broaching is wrought with
dangers, many of which include breaking the law, or at least addressing it
(from one side or the other.)

During WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite
German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides
sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of
weapon they wanted into Bosnia.

I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law
forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third
parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active
role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in
the outcome of the war.

Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And that's
about all we have to go on, isn't it?  

And I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.  There are many levels
at which people react to what they see.  At the most fundamental level, you
do not have to consciously recognize the racial element - you simply tend to
empathize more with people who are like yourself.  As far preferring
Christian over Moslem, I am an atheist myself, and I think you'll agree that
in the US, the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of
religion, nor give it a particularly important place in their world view.

Read this through once or twice.  Then replace ""prince"" with
""government"" or ""president"", as appropriate, and read it again.  

[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by
Daniel Donno.]

	In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have
disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the
cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against
themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they
initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have
destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite
judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular
circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall
nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself
will allow.

	To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince
disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he
proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their
arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,
while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they
are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,
nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by
extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of
the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while
the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties
and dangers should receive advantages.  

	When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by
showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you
distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.
Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would
have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been
discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be
good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful
subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired
state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is
full of examples proving that this is so.

	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he
annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all
the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire
it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render
soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of
the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to
his original domain.

	...

	And since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind
any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants
that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the
reason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction
with the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to
keep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he
will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn
from ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much
easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former
government, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of
those who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to
replace it.

Legal or not, I've seen it done.  Phone records were obtained

And does the phone company require written, subpoena-able evidence
of probable cause in order to process the request?  I suggest that
the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you
could prove the offender had called you at a certain time, your 
chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence
are nil.  My contact with several people who have dealt with cases
of extreme phone harassment (several thousand calls in one case) teaches 
me that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters.

You wanna do masking. Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels
you name ""opaque"" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this
bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea(), and remember to
adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin.

The Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog
mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.

But be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS...

   ...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based
   formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and
   action-based, and the other symbol-based.

True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model
of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.
This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*
of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)

I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After
all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully
distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. 


   I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be
   categorized as a ""symbol manipulator"".

It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think
like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---
these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not
required to do what they do. 

To restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions;
no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic
on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not
escape your notice. 

The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and
theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence,
but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.

However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of
phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can
_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories
science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big
Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc.
It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere
'best fits' for the data.

Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science
requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if
the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason.
Disbelievers are not punished. 

> The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive.

This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_?
My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is
unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God. 

Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes
this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not
change my situation.

No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy,
either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody
would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but
actually no existing being could give an answer. 

Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also
ask: ""Why nothing exists?"" This is equivalent to my counter-question,
""why nothing exists in nothingness"". 

Now, ""why anything exists"" is equivalent to ""why something exists in
somethingness"".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies
for the poor wording in my previous post.

I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence,
in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still
leave open the question ""why this, and not that"", and this is where
theistic explanations come in.

Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.

> We come to this. Either ""I am, therefore I am."", or ""I am for a reason.""

This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not?
Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has
no meaning in His case. 

If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be. 
From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random
reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can
I believe there is any better reason for my existence?

Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better.
My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have
to admit, but I am patient.

No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists,
for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this
should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.

It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question 
""why do I exist, in particular"" is _not_ an invalid question - this
is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to
tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of
another, especially since I found I was deluding myself. 

> My apologies.  I was using why as ""why did this come to be"".  Why did

I think ""pre-existence"" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of
this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that 
perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who
are inside it.

No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think
philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not
knowable?

This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous
other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base
my faith on. 

I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, ""why do I believe""
or ""why I don't believe"".

If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript.
I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware
plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language
that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of
handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser
Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.
It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower
resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product
uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent
PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation
processed PS.

The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for
the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.

We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was
accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts
the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript
processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it
is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also
accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but
Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is
responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our
camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's
demo though).

I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be
surprised if there are several.

So these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish,
but there are certainly exceptions.  If you write a paper which includes
sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is
classified.  As I understand the law, nuclear weapons design is
_automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself.  I believe you
are then not allowed to read your own paper.

A less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are
about to run into, you can be fined, even though you might argue that you
broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman.  The charge
is interfering with a police officer, which is quite similar what you would
be doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip.

Don't tell me that you think this violates the Constitution -- find some
court cases which have struck down such laws.  Many people would not be
comforted by the fact that the government violated their rights when it
imprisoned them.

Fact:  Both Janet Reno and Bill Clinton have admitted responsibility,
       even grief, over the deaths in Waco.

Fact:  Regardless of who started the fire, there are more than enough
       things on tape to make a civil rights case against these two.
       Cruel and unusual punishment (dying tortured rabbits on tape?)
       come to mind.  

Fact:  It is a federal felony to infringe civil rights under color of
       law; where death is involved, this offense carries a penalty
       of life in prison.

Fact:  Impeachment is allowable for ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""
       Anything that's a federal felony should qualify.

Conclusion:  We have NO CHOICE, if we are an honest people, but to

     What kind of brainless clod doesn't understand the difference 
     between a ""PROPOSED BILL, BLOCKED IN CONGRESS"" and an ""EXECUTIVE
     ORDER, ISSUED BY CLINTON, AND CRAMMED DOWN OUR THROATS"".

     
  Here, let me give a remedial course in thinking:

     In order to create the appearance of low interest rates, Uncle Sam
     has shifted his debt from long-term to short-term securities.

     In effect, Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into
     one giant S&L, waiting to blow.

     Short-term rates rise --->  Interest payments on Deficit rise --->
     Uncle Sammy has to borrow more ---->  Causing Short-term rates to rise.

     Uncle Sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop.  His options:

       i) Raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount
       ii)  Make truly unimaginable spending cuts

    Results of i):  large numbers of pissed-off citizens
    Results of ii): large numbers of pissed-off citizens


    Uncle Sammy has thoughtfully taken the initiative to pre-empt the use
    of communication newtworks to foster a nation-wide, grassroots

	The reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to:
1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might
   have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with
   it or actually having this disorder ) and
2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated
   with seizures over the internet.

Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours
after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston
and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition.
This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in
learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with
hospitals, procedures...etc.

I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed 
quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight
as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs
and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal,
but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests,
body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not
know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot
of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is where
we stand right now....

If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above,
any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing
from you. I am not trying to play doctor here, but only trying to gather
information about it. As I know now, these particular types of disorders
are still not really well understood by the medical community, and so I'm
going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle
insight. Thanks.

You know ed,...  You're right!  Andi shouldn't be comparing
Israel to the Nazis.  The Israelis are much worse than the
Nazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for
Germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the
damn Jews.  The Holocaust never happened anyway.  Ample
evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard, Dept. of History,
and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU, have shown that the
Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel.

The Japanese spacecraft, Hiten, crashed on the Moon last weekend.  For the
past three years it has made several lunar flybys and even did some
aerobraking experiments with Earth's atmosphere.  It was placed in lunar
orbit in February 1992, and I guess it finally ran out of fuel and was

Nearly all the professors have PhDs.  I haven't had a professor who didn't,
though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an M.A.  A friend
had an instructor who didn't have a degree at all, but because he had
been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway.

At Sonoma State University, typical class size is 20 to 30 per class.
Teaching is definitely more the goal, and sometimes, it actually happens.
The best professors at Sonoma State U. are equivalent to the best 
professors I had at UCLA and USC.

No one should EVER rely on just a magazine to determine what car they
buy, I don't care what magazine. Btw, I subscribe to three other 
auto rags, I just think CU is getting a bum rap by these macho men
from hell who think real men should read . . . .

Statements like what you said above have no meaning. People keep on
saying ""CU is only good for dishwashing detergent"" or as you
said:""Relying on Consumer Reports . . . . is like. . .""  and that is
all they say. 

If there were as critical of themsevles as they are of CU maybe there
would be some real content.

Funny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out
Vanbiesbrouck's mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect
of:
""You see?  He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask 
and he can't stop a beachball!""

You may or may not take Cherry seriously at all, but I cracked up when I heard
it.

I think Ed Belfour has the current best mask in the NHL btw.  I also like
Moog's, and I'll give Fuhr's new one an honourable mention, although I haven't
seen it closely yet (it looked good from a distance!).  What's also neat is
Chevaldae's in Detroit; they call him ""Chevy"" so he has two checkered flags
painted at the top as in an auto race.

This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a
way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)
to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to
get a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out!
I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns
one slot into three.  I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots,
as I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there.
My other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem).

If there is such an expander, does that screw up performance of
everything else?  I'd hate to buy a new motherboard! :-(

Good thing i stuck in a couple of question marks up there.

I seem to recall, somebody built  or at least proposed a wasp waisetd
Passenger civil transport.  I thought it was a 727,  but maybe it
was a DC- 8,9???   Sure it had a funny passenger compartment,
but on the other hand  it seemed to save fuel.

I thought Area rules  applied even before transonic speeds,  just
not as badly.

First of all, the chip doesn't do that.  It runs at 16 megabits/second,
which is far beyond what you need for voice.  It's obviously intended
for data as well, and on high-speed lines at that.

Second -- what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone?
I don't care how fancy that chip is; it's not as fancy as the roomful
of analyzers at Fort Meade running the program they'll have 5 years from
now.  They can't update every Clipper chip that's out there.

Third -- if they did do this preprocessing in the chip, it would probably
have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns.  If
nothing else, that would hurt the acceptability of the product.  The
V.32bis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly-
massaged voice as is; add any more to the mix, and you're completely out
of the ballpark.

So I should be very comfortable that 500,000,000 people want to convert me to
Islam. Or, to convert me to ANYTHING. 

There are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.

'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or
my God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.

This does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some
friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches
and cheap booklets about some church ....

And when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert 
everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.


Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related
violence' ? 

Why not let 'the other, more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care 
your business?. You do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are)
as long as you want to change their thinking.

  In a word, yes.  I don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of
impact on the power of God.  In the past, God gave us the ability to create
life through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life
through in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely 
cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to
approach the glory of God.
  The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we
will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality
unwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!
  No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't
impinging on God's power.  It's only when we attempt to gain control of the
spiritual world, those things that can't be approached through science and 
logic, that we begin to interfere with God.

I'm all in favor of drug legalization, but I do see some problems with
it. My hope is that people disposed to doing so would simply overdose
quickly, and be done with it, before making a mess of thisgs.

One difference will _probably_ be the same difference as between OS2 and
Windows 3.x now--one will likely have a lot of software available for
it and one won't (emulation, with the inevitable incompatibilities that
crop up in spite of all the contrary claims, just doesn't count when you
_have_ to use a certain software package that doesn't quite run properly
under the emulation...). Developers want to channel their resources toward
a platform that has a large installed base, and in a case like that the
platform that is most successfully _marketed_ (regardless of its relative
sophistication) will win.

Okay all my friends are bitching at me that the map I made in Appsoft Draw

up the .eps, but does fine with the TIFF and ImageViewer0.9a behaves with
flying colors except it doesn't convert worth *&^^% ;-) )

  Please is there any way I can convert this .drw from Appsoft 1.0 on the NeXT

Jim,

There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread
that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can
be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need
for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is
no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by
physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is
determnined.
This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all
its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it
acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no
event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less
value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-
an event can have value. 
The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,
from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only
significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental
processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical
activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human
mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a
hill.
How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing
the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On
what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It
seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you
have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what
in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to
establish your values.
Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what
difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or
otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only
way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the
objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it
- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer
that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries
no weight in any ""absolute"" sense.
That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God
or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your
nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled
with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your
objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been
conditioned; there is no ""truth"" content. The whole of your
intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.
I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and
to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human
thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded
yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,
etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no
weight whatsoever.

{Interesting that you would respond ""emotionally"" in defense of the 
government. Maybe there is a beating heart there.}

For the record though, the biggest-baddest goverment on earth claims 
the most sovereignty over man. Best I can tell God allows anyone to
go to hell who wants to. Omnipotency logically determines that ""allowing""
and ""sending"" mean the same thing.  (Mere human concepts of course.)

So come on WDS. Why bother to try some flimsy facade of logic. Waco

by me. Noted and announced -- for the record. Just giving the govern-

concerns.

But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda.  Remember, if you
asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would
probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at
least some were able to tolerate it.

You see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general
frenzy.

Well, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity
of the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for
people that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems
for us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking
clinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.

So, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a

Yes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However,
I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted
with what *could* happen (an what may be likely).

Well, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the
motto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed
in a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say,
but I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively
despise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.

>>>No christian

Well, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think
that it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can't say that these people
(just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their
faiths.

So, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?

Anyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto
somehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.

That is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of
the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included
all atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes
(although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus.
They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not
mentioned.

So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions
should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly.
I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.

>[...]  Based on this idea I doubt that any additional expense would

I think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
being on our currency.

>Disregarding the digression of the other motto...If it is used for

Well, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it
should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the
consequences.

Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.

Why not?  It is the majority that put it there.

But do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember

you include this in your little survey that you were conducting?

You need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think

No, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court
Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a
Constitutional Amendment.

And, in order for the Court to rule on something, a case usually must be
presented.

hat the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my

the problem had something to do with the Quadra.  Even with the
Quadra, they mostly worked OK.  The problem occurred when I ejected
a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes
saying ""This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware""
even though there was no cartridge in the drive.

That's a twin-cam, right?  There's a steel guard right next to
the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the
engine cases, and it's needed.  There's probably not enough room
to fit a bigger sprocket.

I'd be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 5% ratio
change rather than adding one to the front for about 7%.  If you
raise the overall gear ratio too much you'll impair the bike's
rideability, because the gears will be far enough apart that
there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at
any given speed.  Honda 750s don't have the widest of power
bands.

My MacClassic mouse died.  I dissected it and determined that it is
the microswitch, that senses the click, that is stuck in the depressed
mode.  This tragedy prompts the following questions:

1.	Is it easy to find a microswitch that I could solder into the
	place of the old switch ?

2.	I have old mice (Max+, Mac 512Ke), can they be used with some
	adapter ?

The 4-bit server should work fine.  As far as I know, Xterminals
running older versions can run the latest apps as long as the host 
machine has the R5 libraries installed. I could be wrong though.

I thought Bill James' latest book completely and totally sucked.  I bought
it, but will not purchase anything of his ever again without THOROUGHLY
looking at it first.  What tripe.

The book is inconsistent, and filled with selective analysis.  James
claims to be looking forward, and then makes some absolutely bizarre
statements of value.  Not only that, but I got the impression he
probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name
on it. 

To say I was disappointed is a grand understatement.

I watched it live, and have re-watched it several times, and from the press  
vantage point, there was only one starting point visible, where the tank  
punched in on the windward side, and the winds whipped that fire across the  
whole, dry, wooden, structure in minutes.  Faned by the 30 mph gusts, and the  
Hueys.   If there were other fires started, they were not visible, nor were  
they needed to cause the flame progression I observed.

Also, Alomar got a FAR greater boost from his home park than Baerga did from 
his. And ""six or seven home runs""? Hmm.

So, if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in Toronto, you'd take 
Alomar. Anywhere else, and you'd probably take Baerga.

I share Dennis's outrage over a similar manner.  I have recently become aware
that my health insurance includes coverage for illness and injuries
suffered by Christians.  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums
may be used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is divine
punishment for their sinful conduct.  In addition these folks are able to
avail themselves of such alternative therapies as Lourdes, Fatima,
Morris Cerullo, Benny Hinn, etc.  In any case as ""Jesus Saves' I feel
that there is no reason for them to be covering their bets at my
expense.  I would like to request that I be exempted from Christian
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.

There was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of
Transactions On Graphics. I believe Maureen Stone was one of
the authors. Sorry not to be more specific. I don't have the
reference here with me.

The article actually was more general than this, giving a way to decide
whether a given (cubic) Bezier curve contains cusps, intersection points
or whatever wierdness. The same treatment is also available in SIGGRAPH 89

I have been for a fairly hard run in an MX5, what they lack in power they

They are a fairly light car with a low center of gravity and a quite free

Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has been
stressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was.  He stressed how
likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He
was concerned with the safety of the children.
 
What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure
Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI
offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the
permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?
 
What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible.
They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their
electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears
with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept
limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on
David Koresh.
 
Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping
to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack
the the tanks.
 
It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over
the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the
federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools
at the ATF who planed the raid.
 
Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have
resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.
 
If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.
Instead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+.  Incompetent
law enforcement can kill you!

Can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bi-directional

I have successfully used one on a Toshiba laptop by enabling bit 0 of port
0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie
""0"" for output, ""1"" for input).

The same code does not work on my desktop machine. I have heard that i might
have to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work.

For a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER I/O cards and have been
running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am
pretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.


Any information would be greatly appreasiated.

Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room.
Fully stocked, it cost ~$40,000.  I think it is worth the money.
Only problem is when you get into accident(it doesn't usually break down
unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something
stupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate. 
Parts are over priced also.  One of my friend had accident in past snow
storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender.

Well, if you test drive Land Cruiser, all other SUV look like toys.
One of magazine writer called it ""Land Bruiser"".  

If you have $40,000 to spare for SUV, get Land Cruiser and forget Lange Rover.

Sometimes.  It depends on your monitor and your timing.  If you don't
have enough vertical front porch and you use XOR composite sync you can
get even/odd tearing at the top of the screen, which is very sensitive
to the HHOLD control.  It looks like what you would expect if you
scanned the even fields (say) onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the
upper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube. 
With proper composite sync (equalizing pulses) the interlace is rock
solid.

What a great day! Got back home last night from some fantastic skiing
in Colorado, and put the battery back in the FXSTC. Cleaned the plugs,
opened up the petcock, waited a minute, hit the starter, and bingo it
started up like a charm! Spent a restless night anticipating the first
ride du saison, and off I went this morning to get my state inspection
done. Now my bike is stock (so far) except for HD slash-cut pipes, and
all went well with my New Hampshire State Inspection (meaning all my
lights worked OK) until the dude produces a decibel meter and tells me
about the new NH law about MC noise.....huh?  sez I....and he has me
start her up and rev to about 3000 rpm....I FAIL cuz I register 120 DB,
and the max allowed is 110! If I fail with these pipes, there are gonna
be a whole lotta seriously pissed off bikers round here when they go
for inspection.

*&%^*$%*^*%*&

But hey, its a new experience! I have never really felt like a menace
to society before! I parked, dismounted and walked in to my building
with a slight swagger to my step, and a narrow lidded look... I sensed
my faculty colleagues unease with my new intimidating status...and
women's glances seemed to linger just a little longer....or perhaps
that was my imagination.......*sigh*

Now I need to install my new BUB pipes and single fire ignition....I
wonder how I will do after that!?

     --------------------------------------------------
  
    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're
  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own
  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps
  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,
  ""bullshit filters"".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.
  
Later in the same post:
     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building
  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and
  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.

Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are
""inclined"" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those
claims are still ludicrous, however.

Previously Awesley had written:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

Prompting me to write:
  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

To which Awesley replied:
  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.

But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the
notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion
because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But
that too is ludicrous.

I wrote:
  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been
  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about
  it. 

Awesley relied:
     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an
  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it
  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an
  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged
  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.
  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but
  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also
  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
  assert that I claimed they were truth.

Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. 
Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's
without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on
it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying
""this has gone far enough.""  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis
for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. 
Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and
everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it
had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own
research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is
extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. 
Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I
do not.

I wrote:
  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. 

Awesley wrote:
     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the 
  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 
  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.
  So it would have been an Army cover-up.

Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has
taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half
decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said ""yes, I
shelled Americans,"" or ""I gave the orders to fire the cannons,"" or ""I
helped cover it up""?

I wrote:
  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I
prefer
  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that
  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.

Awesley replied:
    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe
  that they did fire their guns.

Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. 
Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?

Awesley concludes:
     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read
  this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the
  account I cited.

Actually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as
well as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last
word to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with
impunity--I am dropping the subject.

There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report
on the situation in the O.T.  But, as most people used to see on TV, the
Israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the O.T.  The Israelis 
used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters.  
So, this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine.
They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in Palestine.

The desertification of the arid Negev

Agricultural Settlement in the Negev III.   Development of the

Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase ""the
Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom"" was trumpeted
throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David
Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: ""It's by our
pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land
into a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in
abandoned desert areas"".

Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that
during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for
centuries previous, a productive human presence was to be found in
all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys
of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These
were the Bedouin Arabs.

The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern
part, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's
cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the
12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the
State of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond
recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev
are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief
role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture
lands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and
dumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli
Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area
cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish
pastoral activity.

I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin
before and after 1948
-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,
according to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba
sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or
Southern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin
Arabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep
and 22,000 goats.

The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in
the north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per
year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the
Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more
than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers
after 40 years of ""making the desert bloom""*

The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of
barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming
techniques were primitive, but production was based solely on
animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal
production, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.
Production increased considerably during the rainy years and
diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture
animals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight
quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many
waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the
result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh
local conditions.

After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev
Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The
10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of
40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150
mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out
of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,
spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin
shepherds from roaming.

A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.
But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these
Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure
was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields
in order that the land could be transferred to the army.

No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held
today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of
the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized
by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now
confined to seven ""development towns"", or *sowetos*, established
for them.

I'm sure it is, and I am not amused.  Every time I read that part of the

complexity of the spec anyway- because I think their ""arbitrary but

SECRET PURPOSE OF FALKLANDS WAR;  [with IN-VISIBILITY Technology]

Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER #74 of 80

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,
DC  20006.

   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,
1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.

  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South
Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute
between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept
Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far
more than that.

   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a
giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,
fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South
Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the
hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on
all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the
Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.

   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of
the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a
counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.

   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of
time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is
coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are
overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot
simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time
without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British
will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no
matter how risky they may be.

   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no
choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That
reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered
losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will
be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by
the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts
will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle
losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice
but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking
even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,
my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.

   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,
ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing
countless commentators referring to the British task force as an
""armada"" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very
uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400
years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,
but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it
changed the course of history--and it was none other than the
English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.

   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the
reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion
fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. 
They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake
and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada
by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped
with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of
reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered
the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely
half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's
defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened
the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its
expansion into a truly global empire.

   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full
circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the
world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now
the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in
confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for
invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four
hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;
today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.

   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake
Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of
the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's
naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may
well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal
Navy.

   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:

Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND
Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.

Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month
it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and
a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great
Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the
Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been
countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it
calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing
in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about
them.

   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba
is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. 
After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer
than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the
remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,
and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are
watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.

   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all
about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's
doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's
got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,
submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have
even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. 
Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated
and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and
submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and
sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has
grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada
numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has
already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.

   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this
fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the
major media is ""oil.""  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist
under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,
but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it
explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina
this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine
seizure of South Georgia Island.

   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with
no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South
Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia
Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,
glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. 
On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or
historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it
stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.

   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by
Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took
over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,
Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,
not Britain.

   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It
has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or
Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even
more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's
leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They
were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island
could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were
setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island
was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's
military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia
Island at all?

   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,
not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an
enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation
buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. 
The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret
installation, together with two other similar installations which
I will describe shortly.

   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many
years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear
war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in
Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the
details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain
and verify them.

   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of
this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat
that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.

   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of
the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The
mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the
Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are
behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of
the ""PROJECT Z"" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase
is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both
Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR
ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the
existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around
the world.

   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are
working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of
other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to
ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in
Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie
smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered
remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the
secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the
open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining
fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using
that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of
the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to
pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off
NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel
and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a
race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.

   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are
benefitting from war preparations which were started by the
Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since
the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United
States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United
States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal
power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. 
But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades
both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller
Brothers.

   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world
domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half
secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. 
It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret
while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the
details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By
deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United
States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. 
Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be
unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.

   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the
Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the
late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that
the war being planned would have very different effects on the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United
States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern
Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great
Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the
strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are
relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected
that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern
Hemisphere war.

   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious
radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas
not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the
war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is
very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern
Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from
the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then
it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image
of this process takes up the southern half of the planet. 
Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,
but very little of the air changes places.

   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming
nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for
generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the
Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. 
This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A
quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller
cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I
discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson
Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during
the war.  He accomplished this as so-called ""Coordinator of
Hemispheric Defense"" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
So that takes care of the South American continent and its
natural resources.

   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller
control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,
especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the
efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER
No. 36.

   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land
masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and
New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the
Rockefellers.

   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military
installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming
war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the
surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern
Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually
recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire
would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third
generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to
inherit the Earth.

   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after
the war, some means would have to be available to project
military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against
Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the
beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar
military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A
minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based
in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the
reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the
Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in
existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built
and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no
small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was
essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. 
The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and
naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the
secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear
attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered
prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.

   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection
against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all
these plans were still in the early stages of development, the
answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to
Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden
naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs
which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is
a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off
with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water
a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.

   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided
that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the
Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of
candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered
coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas
were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. 
Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the
equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too
many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy
impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for
the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.

   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were
selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was
selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71
three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme
importance in the coming war.

   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand
naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located
close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South
Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes
down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the
installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,
which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island
facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.

   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since
World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even
closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location
is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep
under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also
too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New
Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South
Pacific.

   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. 
That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located
perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The
tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret
installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. 
It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of
New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island
was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the
northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from
the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain
took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. 
Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia
Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.

   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New
Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. 
The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build
other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD
installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these
techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve
construction access directly from the sea instead of overland. 
In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in
appearance both during and after construction.

   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let
ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well
camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the
entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When
sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you
know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction
projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying
around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house
the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and
debris was disposed of at sea.

   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be
outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake
disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed
greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal
role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary
of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara
presided over the public paring back of America's visible
military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling
of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that
shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,
was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in
New Zealand and South Georgia Island!

   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication
facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and
built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two
ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is
an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true
in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing
techniques.

   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret
installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of
certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear
powered--nuclear ""subs""; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;
and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin
was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and
for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been
financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we
constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three
carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft
whose manufacture was financed the same way!

   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are
all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the
secret naval ships possess one key difference.

   Last month I revealed that the so-called ""Stealth Program"" has
succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility
shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance
by distorting light waves in its vicinity.

   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into
crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of
the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been
outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth
principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes
because there is more room for the powerful equipment that
generates the field.

   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American
Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on
earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world
domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my
friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United
States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in
control, and they are bent on war.

   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is
being called the ""Falklands crisis.""

Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described
""PROJECT Z"", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR
WAR ONE.

   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here
are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in
Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike
the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war
with Russia.

   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in
certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable
war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in
stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United
States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand
strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially
their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and
rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it
will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks
themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.

   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two
months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for
nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is
fast running out.

   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward
war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in
this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are
equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the
Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the
new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two
mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in
certain ways.

   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a
limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between
the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting
between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning
point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,
and is responsible for the so-called ""Falkland crisis"" now
dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new
relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far
short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be
settled between them, but for the time being they have called a
truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly
enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.

   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to
slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. 
If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller
cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last
summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war
timetable will also give more breathing space for additional
anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.

   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February
that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very
quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect
fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.

   The exact details of the ""PROJECT Z"" war plan are not known to
either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines
are known to be as I described last month.

   It was decided that military action should be devised that
would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the
Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the
Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working
together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to
devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. 
The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these
bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to
attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine
provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.

   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both
secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be
attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the
Bolshevik war plan still workable.

   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault
on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was
no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force
which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside
world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the
very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.

   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different
matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was
also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected
the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military
assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her
long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.

   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has
dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives
were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government
military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland
Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to
enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine
generals were not told everything about the situation by any
means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to
do.

   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were
promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the
shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine
hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military
assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the
troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller
cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With
these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,
the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.

   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack
plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,
landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia
Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old
buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they
also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,
always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as
expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship ""Endurance"" put 22
Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down
the Argentine flag.

   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine
Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a
boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that
South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered
that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now
came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from
Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.

   During late March, Argentine military forces started
assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  ""Nothing new"",
thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out
threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed
that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine
forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this
time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine
public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims
to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next
day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia
Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance
initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of
view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were
overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13
alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint
Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.

   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine
forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. 
Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the
team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the
cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was
set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian
members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,
April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what
was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under
attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint
Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the
mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a
matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling
of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next
step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a
weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it
would be a nerve gas.

   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the
British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be
described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the
so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik
controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, ""Me, too""
any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against
Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war
plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective
countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered
that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.

   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval
armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of
the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding
around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling
would break through into the roof of the naval base in about
three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South
Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The
forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend
themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships
were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to
sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with
tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance
doors would be suicide.

   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was
seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. 
The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He
was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the
Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack
preparations.

   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other
secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. 
The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on ""Red
Alert.""  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin
base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at
sea undergoing ""sea trials"", but that still left seven (7) major
ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the
nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.

   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,
Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was
alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. 
Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from
certain officials.  He got them!

   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories
about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while
negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. 
The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as
possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived
in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The
official stories about ""slow movement"" of the British armada were
intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,
the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,
then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the
announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South
Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.

   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British
fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two
weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint
Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it
was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a
shambles of the plan.

   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent
left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was
announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into
trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on
a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on
South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and
combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In
moments the ship was without any command, its communications and
radar silenced.  Then a Russian ""sub"" closed in and quickly
finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke
apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is
known, there were no survivors.

   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two
results, both important:

First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic
by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a
configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost
valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the
progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for
arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching
out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint
commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.

The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was
flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible
action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting
involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could
be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the
seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in
southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational
headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast
of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to
provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible
to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I
explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the
Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded
communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes
headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South
Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of
South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the
South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint
Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been
flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in
New Zealand!

   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by
other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out
of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos
Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he
was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top
Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have
revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did
not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four
days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded
his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, ""Time is running out."" 
And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.

   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the
hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military
analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed
until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was
still out of range.

   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the
long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was
detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the
effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed
everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the
bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside
sufficiently to badly disable them.

   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging
on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands
awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to
the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect
against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the
tactics which the Russians employed.

   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships
using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. 
As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which
PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations
of the ships to the attack submarines.  The ""subs"" were armed
with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to
explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been
thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective
shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right
through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. 
Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik
Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went
their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from
around the world.

   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local
time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. 
That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public
with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was
wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught
always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning
from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian
military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret
Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,
bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific
fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By
working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won
the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.

Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression
that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real
war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are
watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That
aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been
promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.

   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing
for a public announcement that the United States will side with
Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat
up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to
fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be
explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the
Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and
tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.

   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now
concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On
all sides now we are hearing about the so-called ""nuclear freeze
movement.""  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all
kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent
months, there have even been referenda popping up on election
ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are
banding together to warn the public about what would happen if
there were a nuclear war.

   We are being told that all this is just popping up
spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and
nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet
now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have
spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you
believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,
and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and
money--and plenty of it.

   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations
machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller
cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it
does, they will lose everything because they are not in a
position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the
Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is
a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in
its power to prevent a nuclear war.

   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller
cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them
and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does
not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the
Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity
right now for the Rockefellers.

   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and
they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with
the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of
the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear
war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of
reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.

   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective
with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is
renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old
dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly
provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar
campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan
Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. 
The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on
that latent fear as a tool of power.

   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands
crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller
propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that
surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new
super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the
bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new
organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working
name, though this may be changed, is the ""World Nonproliferation
Council.""  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of
nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be
to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.

                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY

   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO
LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called
Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret
Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern
Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the
Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down
the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the
results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal
Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea
may well be at hand.

   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our
United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They
differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we
are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the
power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture
tells us, our Lord ""...has not given us the spirit of fear; but
of power, of love, and of a sound mind.""  We must learn to wage
peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, ""Blessed are the
peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.""

   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,
and may God bless each and every one of you.

                         April 23, 1993

1.  The Magellan spacecraft continues to operate normally, gathering
gravity data to plot the density variations of Venus in the
mid-latitudes.  The solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees
and spacecraft temperatures dropped 2-3 degrees C.

2.  An end-to-end test of the Delayed Aerobraking Data readout
process was conducted this week in preparation for the Transition
Experiment.  There was some difficulty locking up to the data frames,
and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in
equipment at the tracking station.

3.  Magellan has completed 7277 orbits of Venus and is now 32 days
from the end of Cycle 4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.

4.  Magellan scientists were participating in the Brown-Vernadsky
Microsymposium at Brown University in Providence, RI, this week.  This
joint meeting of U.S. and Russian Venus researchers has been
continuing for many years.

5.  A three-day simulation of Transition Experiment aerobraking
activities is planned for next week, including Orbit Trim Maneuvers
and Starcal (Star calibration) Orbits.

Actually, they generally claim that (b) their particular interpretation of
scripture/revelation *is* this objective morality.  That there are two
conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about
(a).  It tells us at least one fake objective morality exists.

The next logical step is to deduce that any given religion's objective
morality could be the fake one.  So caveat emptor.

I understand, believe it or not, and there are any number of kinds of 
conversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider 
using this scheme for.  On the other hand, I don't see ""Clipper"" as providing 
a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why 
I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious 
security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.

There is still plenty of market for real crypto.

They cost an arm and a leg, though. ""Clipper"" is obviously aimed at the mass 
market.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.

This is old news.  I can do this now.

There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a 
large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even 
simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department 
of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to 
compete in international information systems markets.

Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in 
the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be 
the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to 
hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in 
confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to 
order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I 
want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on 
electronically.

This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on 
crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.

Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe, 
all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put 
more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is ""good enough for 
anyone who has nothing to hide.""  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just 
as much as ""no one needs an assault rifle"".

Hell, a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to.  The only thing
that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  Sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety.

No flames here.  All your points are well taken.  Guess I still have a

assume too many things like more bullets are better and that sort of

DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's 
TGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directory
on the wuarchive.

They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,
dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe
there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or
dtax.exe.

I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing 
away the afternoons since.  The programmes are all a bit buggy and
definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very
well written. 

The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you
figure out the tricks.

I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph
without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have
the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.

If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing 
to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time
just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then 
it would work...

By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff

At 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.
Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of
17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to
the playoff-bound Blues.

The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.
With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the
final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit
playing.

They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared
with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep
and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.
Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating
supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the
shot had gone into the net after time had expired.

``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,"" Blues coach Bob Berry said.

If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'
disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making
the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.

``It wasn't pretty at the end,"" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as
good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but
it did.""

Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.
Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this
season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks
in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at
Chicago Stadium.

The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,
their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points
behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,
which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its
first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.

The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous
Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.

``It's a shame we let down,"" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score
two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.
``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have
ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.""

Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.
``We won, and that's all that matters,"" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3
for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.""

Some players didn't have a problem.

``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,"" said Rich
Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You
can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.

``It was disappointing to see what was going on.""

Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,
he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.

``I didn't know it was final,"" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the
bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,
and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the
end.""

The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard
operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score
showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third
period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.

``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,""
Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.""

If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might
bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.

Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd
going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,
Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.

With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked
defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the
rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.

Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski
after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.

Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the 
rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of
the season and reminded him of a special friend.

Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form
of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.

``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,"" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and
I know he was watching. I know he's happy.""

Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo
at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds
later, making it 5-1.

Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland
scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass
from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.

Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third
period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals
to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third
period.

The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the
winner. ``We were in there,"" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.""

Subject: Vanishing font problem....
Organization: Department of Mathematics, Queen's University at Kingston
Lines: 25

   A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation.
When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear
with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows
applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a
second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,
giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.

   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier
colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only
opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL
X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different
font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the
default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font
directories/hash-tables.

   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different
font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?

More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),
       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.
       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.

	Their testimony would be a contradiction of the plaintiff's charge (and

trying to get out (and provoking all sorts of sympathetic 'gross, burned alive'

	They are two witnesses who didn't come forth until after the first
trial.  While it would be ""tough luck"" for GM if they new about these witnesses
beforehand, IMO this constitutes ""new evidence"".

	No, I support rulings that deny new trials on those grounds.

With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and
so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:

1.  What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns
VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)

2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
C650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing
would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic
board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)

Just wondering....

While I can't think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights,
I know that Saab started using them about 15 years ago.  My 1975 Saab 99
didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition
to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another
set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who
don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic
growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out
of the front fender, which incorporated amber ""parking lights"", amber side
marker lights/reflectors, white ""cornering lamps"" (like American luxury
cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators
on, and white ""backup lights"" aimed towards the back of the car when you
have selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front
mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's
toys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the
wheels turned while backing up.

For an all out sports car, I'd go for the RX-7 without the sports
suspension (which is too stiff.)  For a little more practicality and more
comfort, the Nissan 300ZX Turbo is a good buy.  And for a good dose of
luxury, the Lexus SC300 is perfect (with a manual transmission of course.) 
However, the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like it's looks,
the performance is supposed to be great, almost race car like.  I don't
particulary like the Mitsubishi 3000GT's or the Dodge Stealths as they are
too heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car.

- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its 
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render 
reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its 
rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an 
issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that 
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States 
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts 
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures 
to the contrary.

- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement 
protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued 
coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet
Armenia.

- We also demand that the United States return to the policies 
advocated by U.S. Ambassador Bristol and other enlightened statesmen,
who have undertaken a just, human and benevolent attitude towards 
the rights of the Muslim people and the just resolution of their Case.

- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.

CIS Commander Pulls Troops Out of Karabagh :

""Elif Kaban, a Reuter correspondent in Agdam, reported that after a battle 
 on Wednesday, Azeris were burying scores of people who died when Armenians 
 overran the town of Khojaly, the second-biggest Azeri settlement in the 
 area. 'The world is turning its back on what's happening here. We are dying 
 and you are just watching,' one mourner shouted at a group of journalists.""

Armenian Soldiers Massacre Hundreds of Fleeing Families:

""The attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the 
 women and children.  They then turned their guns on the terrified refugees.  
 The few survivors later described what happened: 'That's when the real 
 slaughter began,' said Azer Hajiev, one of the three soldiers to survive.  
 'The Armenians just shot and shot. And they came in and started carving 
 up people with their bayonets and knives.'  A 45-year-old man who had been 
 shot in the back  said:' We were walking through the brush. Then they opened 
 up on us and people were falling all around.  My wife fell, then my child.""

 'Women and children had been scalped,' said Assad Faradzev, an aide to

Killings Rife in Nagorno-Karabagh, Moldova:

 Fred Hiatt
 The Washington Post, 3/3/92

Bodies Mark Site of Karabagh Massacre:

""A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijanis to collect their dead 
 and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest.  All are the bodies 
 of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clorhing of workers. Of the 31 
 we saw only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing 
 uniform.  All the rest were civilians, including eight women and three small
 children. Two groups, apparently families, had fallen together, the children 
 cradled in the women's arms.  Several of them, including one small girl, had 
 terrible head injuries: only her face was left. Survivors have told how they 
 saw Armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground.""
 Anatol Lieven

Karabagh Survivors Flee to Mountains:

""Geyush Gassanov, the deputy mayor of Khocaly, said that Armenian troops 
 surrounded the town after 7 pm on Tuesday. They were accompanied by six 
 or seven light tanks and armoured carriers.  'We thought they would just 
 bombard the village, as they had in the past, and then retreat.  But they 
 attacked, and our defence force couldn't do anything against their tanks.'  
 Other survivors described how they had been fired on repeatedly on their 
 way through the mountains to safety. 'For two days we crawled most of the 
 way to avoid gunfire,' Sukru Aslanov said.  His daughter was killed in the 
 battle for Khodjaly, and his brother and son died on the road.""

 The Times (London), 3/3/92

Corpses Litter Hills in Karabagh:

""As we swooped low over the snow covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw 
 the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as 
 they ran...Suddenly there was a thump...[our Azerbaijani helicopter] had 
 been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post...""
 Anatol Lieven
 The Times (London), 3/4/92

""Police in western Azerbaijan said they had recovered the bodies of 
 120 Azerbaijanis killed as they fled an Armenian assault in the 
 disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabagh and said they were blocked from 
 recovering more bodies.""

I also suffer from these video ""artefacts"". My configuration is a
Centris 610, 4/160, 1MB VRAM with a NEC 4FG. It only happens at
832x624, in 8bit colour with virtual memory off during scrolling. This
occurs when the VRAM SIMMS are installed as well as removed.
It seems that the 610 does not like 832x624.

Does anyone *not* have these problems in the above mentioned

Keywords: MITI

I have a thermal fuse from a Apple Laserwriter II power supply (Made
by Cannon) that I need to replace.  The fuse is not the standard
tubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc, but is a 
rectangular plastic package, much like a transistor or diode.  It
is about 0.2""x0.2""x0.1"", with both leads coming out of one of the
0.1""x0.1"" sides.  I have been told that it was made by MITI, a asian
company, but I can find no information as to a supplier.  This fuse
is rated at 1A, 130C.  Does anyone have a source for this fuse?  I
only need 5 or so, which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even want
to talk to me, let alone, deal with me.

Please advise via E-mail.

Thanks,
Pat

  Which one?  The one yesterday, or has there been another?  If it was yester-
day, catch up.

  IMO, 90% of all ""conspiracy"" charges are easily explained by the simple
fact that in these days of instantaneous news transmission, all kinds of
stuff gets said when people really just don't know what the hell's going on.
Then the story changes once the facts are in and suddenly cries of ""its all a 
whitewash!"" start.  Naturally, everybody wants to cover his/her ass.

  Damnfino.  I just tend to take issue with absolute statements that are ob-
viously wrong on their face and tend to inflame, not inform.  The isolation
was significant, but not total.

Sorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys
from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations
in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex
(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least
some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the
children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest
that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a
practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations
in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse
them. By working together ""with good will on both sides"", we may be
able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.

Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for
personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*
stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish
and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the
future.

Well Sweden and Australia, and lord knows wherever else used to drive on

By the 1920s, there was a very active ""good roads"" movement, which had
its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up
steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so,
and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916
that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent
roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic
transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were
crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty
of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly
expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the
first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good
books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco ""America on the
Road"" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called ""The Devil
Wagon in God's Country"" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or
John Bell Rae's auto histories.

As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early
teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel
on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the
right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller
instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I
don't know why.

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.

HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they
are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated
using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY
protein- because it's DEAD!  

Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be 
completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.  

Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax.

My advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is better
to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your
ignorance.  Don't speculate, or at least get some concrete information
before you do!

Yes!  Up the coast, over to Portland, then up I-5.  Really nice most

It seems that a particular program designed for blind people is more important
than trying to interface windows with a way for blind people to use it.
If someone made a voice recognition/multimedia (sound) oriented program,
it would probably been more effective.  I don't know what the original
purpose of interfacing windows was for the person who posted the question

Subject: Voltage Multiplier Problem.
Organization: Computer Science, Liverpool University
Lines: 53
Nntp-Posting-Host: goyt.csc.liv.ac.uk

Hi,

   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor
voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx 
260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases
and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output
voltage as possible. (about 260v).
  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages
(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v
across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.
  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.
 If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will
increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.
These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of
them, So:

1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel 
with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?
  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase
the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more
stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...
as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new
capacitor will 'smooth' this out.

and
2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to
be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out
the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !

  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH
of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my 
dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not
playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long
run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

Email please.... Can't always read the net.....

Thanks in advance..

 Well, yes.  That was a part of my point.  Aspirin has its problems, but
in some situations it is useful.  Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking
anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea
of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,
additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are
not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that
in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.
   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in
some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use
that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have
when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested
by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because
long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.

In the Air Force world at least, the crisis escalates when scale

Of course it is assumed that coffee mugs and other decorative junk has

Sony 1430 monitor, and I would like to use it as a second TV
when my wife is watching sitcoms on our regular TV.  

Perhaps some of the video cards for the Mac accept NTSC input?
I have a IIsi, and I am willing to buy a NuBus adapter.

Thanks in advance for any help,

So long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather than
what we come to *want* to do, we miss the point. The more we love God; the
more we come to love what and whom He loves.

When I find that what I am doing is not good, it is not a sign to try
even harder (Romans 7:14-8:2); it is a sign to seek God. When I am aware 
of Jesus' presence, I usually want what He wants. It is His strenth, His love 
that empowers my weakness.

    GORE JOINS STUDENTS IN ORLANDO FOR FIRST KIDS EARTH SUMMIT
    Will Take Part in Special Town Meeting On the Environment
 ******** SATURDAY, APRIL 17, 1993 - ORLANDO, FLORIDA **********

     WASINGTON -- Joining students from across the United States 
and around the world for the first ever Kids Earth Summit, Vice 
President Al Gore will travel to Orlando, Florida, on Saturday 
(4/17) and participate in a special town hall meeting, hosted by 
Linda Ellerbee for broadcast on Nickelodeon, to hear the young 
people's concerns and share ideas about the environment.

     The Vice President will take part in the ""Kids World 
Council: Plan It for the Planet"" from 2-5 PM (EDT) Saturday 
(4/17) in Orlando, Florida.  He will tour a display of student 
environmental projects, then videotape the town hall meeting 
where he will discuss with student delegates their concerns about 
the environment and their plans for an environmentally sound 
future.

     The town hall meeting will be moderated by Linda Ellerbee 
and taped for a news special, ""Nickelodeon Special Edition:  Plan 
It for the Planet,"" which will air on Sunday, April 18 at 8 PM 
(EDT).  It is sponsored by Nickelodeon and the Children's Earth 
Fund.

     ""Young people care about the environment because they know 
it affects our future.  Across the country and around the world, 
young people are speaking out about the environmental challenges 
we face.  They are identifying problems, thinking about 
solutions, and they are demanding action from their leaders,"" the 
Vice President said.

     The Kids World Council delegates are meeting for three days 
in Orlando to discuss how to save energy and switch to renewable 
energy.  They will be following the format and goals of the Earth 
Summit that took place last year in Rio de Janeiro.  The Vice 
President led the Senate Delegation to the Earth Summit.

     ""I look forward to hearing what young people have to say 
about the environment and their future.  Their insight into the 
world around us is important,"" the Vice President said.

I recently saw a particular third party antenna on a new Camry (not mine,
but it caught my interest) and a new 626.  It seems to replace the
factory power antenna and is about a foot long made of plastic tubing.  I
have seen them on quite a few cars, but I can't find anything more about
them in previous r.a.c articles nor in r.a articles.

I'd like to know all I can, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.

This is in fact a hot topic in medicine these days, and much of the
medical literature is devoted to this.  The most heavily funded studies
these days are for outcome research, and physicians (and others!) are
constantly questionning whether what we do it truly effective in any given
situation.  QA activities are a routine part of every hospital's
administrative function and are required by accreditation agencies.  There
are even entire publications devoted to QA issues.

Getting the court order to reveal the key *also* makes decipherable
all *past* conversations (which may be on tape, or disk, or whatver),
as I understand the proposal. I could be wrong, but I've seen no
mention of ""session keys"" being the escrowed entities.

As the EFF noted, this raises further issues about the fruits of one
bust leading to incrimination in other areas.

But is it any worse than the current unsecure system? It becomes much
worse, of course, if the government then uses this ""Clinton Clipper""
to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main
concern of most of us, I think. The camel's nose in the tent, etc.)

And it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is
increased, thus allowing greater access to ""central office"" records by
the government (the conversations being encrypted, who will object to
letting the government have access to them, perhaps even automatically
archiving large fractions...). This was one of the main objections to
the S.266 proposal, that it would force telecom suppliers to provide
easy access for the government.

One the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted
conversations, now all it takes is one misstep, one violation that
gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt *all* of them!

Do we want anyone to have this kind of power?

Up until last week, I have been running POVray v1.0 on my 486/33 under DOS5
without any major problems.  Over Easter I increased the memory from 4Meg to
8Meg, and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS5.  I had
a go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win3.1 on the same system
and it now works fine, even if a lot slower.  I would like to go back to 
using POVray directly under DOS, anyone any ideas???

Talk about adding insult to injury ... 

I, for one, believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by
a decent administration, not continued.  Instead, it looks like that
ill-gotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment.

Of course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine as
Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church
has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say
that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free
will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also
affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and
Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with
the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). 
For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,
who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final
perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those
without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their
obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need
it, as they had freely chosen hell.
							  ^^^^^^^^^^^
People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own
effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined
them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish
because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were
deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and
sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.

>yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that
>punishment at the last judgement. 

Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some
blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),
for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And
those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one
or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal
punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it
(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were
forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I
need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is
quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from
the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,
Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.

not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we

We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but
does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the
U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an
isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in
the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily
involved, it would not be a ""just war.""  ""Blessed"" after all, ""are the
peacemakers"" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our
actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is
unrelated to anything to justify it for us.

Subject: Can I remove the 68000 under my daughterboard upgrade?
Organization: Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.
Lines: 26

The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:

I have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the
equivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such).

The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has
a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an
entirely easy thing to do) and clean the ""legs"" of the 68000.
Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with
snap on upgrades:  the 68000's ""legs"" will oxidize, causing 
unusual system errors.

Well, that's me.

So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be
fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and
modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of
is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't
acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on
the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.

Will someone provide the extra 3%?

Why would you want to do that? The goal is to do it cheaper (remember,

just use a SSTO and launch from a much cheaper facility.

While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently  
when I bought a new truck.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  
agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax
and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  
When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  
get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  
started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  
miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  
another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  
their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  
brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  
reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  
treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  
deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  
snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  
the turn of events.

Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  
to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  
asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  
that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  
that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  
and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  
pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  
lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  
him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.

A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  
apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  
knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  
it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  
and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....

I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  
decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  
back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  
truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  
incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  
there in my new truck in about 30 mins.

So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  
have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  
person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  
sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  
mistake.

Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  
dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  
I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.

Even if Brett's eventual-return figures were correct -- and they
clearly weren't -- he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '86
blip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors:

1) As Ted notes, not everyone is a long-term investor.  One might find
oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term
that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a
few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with
preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.

2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of
what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects
beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to
unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to ""sell now and save on
taxes.""  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar
advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice
was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),
but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates
(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).

It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal
economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless
pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe
accurately what happens in the real world.

Hai,

In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses).
It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard.
It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is.
I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around.

My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I
consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things:

	- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2
	  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example)
	- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it
	  support (text & graphics)
	- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM
	- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000
	- Support in software

If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like
to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell
me about it.


For the people in Holland:

I am trying to put a 40MB drive from my LC into a case.  It is a Conner
CP3040A.  I can't figure out which jumpers are the SCSI ID jumpers.
Is anyone familiar with this drive?

At the end of the drive (oposite the 50 pin pibbon connector), there
are eleven pins which look like this:


        o o o o o   o   1
          o o o o   o   2

         L5  CR12   C37

where the ""o"" are pins, and the ""L5 CR12 C37"" represent some of the
silk screen notation near these pins.

Elsewhere on the board there are four jumper pads marked E1,E2,E3,E4
on the silk screen.

Does anyone know where the SCSI ID A0,A1,A2 pins are, and where the
drive activity light LED should be plugged into?

Reply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)
Distribution: world

The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in 
x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. 

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today.

69 year old Hatin Nine telling:

-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told
me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''

72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:

- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.
  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are
  Turks, you must die.''

28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:

- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes.''

Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures
of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying
""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's
3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.

Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the
French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human
rights violations. International reactions must be made with international
cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized.

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where
is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,
journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?""
Where are you?

You are asking me to provide objective proof for the existence of
God.  I never claimed to be able to do this; in fact I do not believe
that it is possible to do so.  I consider the existence of God to
be a premise or assumption that underlies my philosophy of life.
It comes down to a matter of faith.   If I weren't a Christian, I
would be an agnostic, but I have sufficient subjective evidence to
justify and sustain my relationship with God.  Again this is a matter
of premises and assumptions.  I assume that there is more to ""life, the
universe and everything"" than materialism; ie that spirituality exists.
This assumption answers the question about why I have apparent spiritual
needs.  I find this assumption consistent with my subsequent observat-
ions.  I then find that God fills these spiritual needs.  But I cannot 
objectively prove the difference between apparent filling of imagined 
spiritual needs and real filling of real spiritual needs.  Nor can I
prove to another person that _they_ have spiritual needs.

Sooner than you expect. Remember 'Cyprus'?

Too bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established 
a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two 
continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and 
Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in 
espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and 
Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under 
German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National 
Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional 
Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, 
Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often 
expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary,
during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and
cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication
in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]

""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it 
 becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical
 operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing."" 

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -
extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San
Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.

 ""...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the 
  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian 
  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish 
  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see 
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise 
  to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would 
  help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of
  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian!
  I don't need your bias.""

The first line of the BAT file sets an environment variable.

My problem is that on some of our machines (running MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows

OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error.  I have raised the amount of environment 
space to 2048 bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS so I know that
I am nowhere near to running out.  If I just click on the MS-DOS icon,
I can create a bunch of environment varibles from the DOS shell.  The problem
is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in
a BAT file fails.  Has anyone seen such behavior before?  I see no place in the

Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral
exploration.

Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth..
You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.

There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so
expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or
tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends 
of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of
the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there
normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and
other expenses you can owe more than what you made.
BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe
600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And
the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks.. 

Basically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to go
cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the
eco-freaks or the protectionist.. 
Such fun we have in these interesting times..

On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they
should not be spoken of in a ""common manner"" or ""trampled under
feet"" such as the Lords name is today.  The ceremonies are
performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside
as being as sacred/holy/uncommon place.  We believe that the 
ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they
are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the
temple.  So from our point of view, when they are brought
out into the public, they are being trampled under feet,
because of misinterpretations and mocking, and it is therefore
offensive to us.

Please do not assume that because of my use of the words
'we' and 'our' that I'm an official spokesman for the LDS
church.  I am merely stating what I believe is the general
feeling among us.  Others feel free to disagree.

1. There is a similar idea here in ex-USSR about how many militioners it needs
   to place a new electric lamp. The answer is nine: one stays on a table and
   holds the lamp, four hold the table and turn it and yet four run around the
   table in opposite direction not to make the first feel bad (when being
   turned). Pitily, it lacks this kind of dark humour as Nick's msg does.
2. To my mind the signature should be smth like:

                  /       _                     __        /  .

The PC World reviewers found out that the Herc people had hard-coded

Taft Electronics, 45th Street between 5th & 6th -- the only one left in

Trans-Am Electronics, Canal Street near 7th Ave -- lots of surplus type

Several other electronics or ""surplus"" type places are still on Canal

I think Bronx Wholesale Radio is still in business -- Fordham Road not

Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.
However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all
five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against
muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do
not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and
open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know
that
historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone
by the death penalty.

My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the
law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate
long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no
precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly
levelling death penalties for apostasy.

I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of ""fasad"". This
ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an
Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was
not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.

I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was
levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication
of the book. However, the charge of ""fasad"" can encompass a
number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations
broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that
the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from
circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the
""crisis"". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not
the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are
levelled at people, not books.

The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the
issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,
presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of
secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people
crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. 
Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost
his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then
Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while
protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily
concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again
attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this
point that the fatwa on ""fasad"" was issued.

The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of
Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of
the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant
will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa
against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The
crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being
played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.

P.S. I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of ""shatim"" also
applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella
of the ""fasad"" ruling.

Probably cheaper than you think.  I'll bet some of my (and yours)

Hi, I've come across a fast triangle fill-draw routine for mode 13h.  By
calling this routine enough times, you have a fast polygon drawing routine.

I think I ftp'ed from wuarchive.wustl.edu:/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/programming.
I have a copy of it so I reupload it there.  The triangle.txt file has this

I recently read that during Bill Clinton's campaign, he stated
that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital.  According to the article, Mr. Clinton
reaffirmed this after winning the presidency.  However,
during recent talks with President Mubarak, Secretary of
State Christopher stated that ""the status of Jerusalem
will be a final matter of discussion between the parties"".

Now I don't want to start a big discussion over the status

And anybody who can get the keys from the escrow company.  This is a

The chip and algorithm are classified.  If you reverse engineer it and
tell people, you are likely to go to jail.

Perhaps some foreign governments or corporations could help us out by
cracking the system outside the USA.  The US government could probably
stop importation of clone hardware, but a software implementation
should be practical.

backdesk.zip is on CICA, but I'm not sure of the whole directory.

Another to throw into the running is topdesk.  It is alsow on CICA, but
I'm not sure where.  It is more complicated then backdesk, but I've found
it to be more stable and more usefull.  I recomend it to people who

Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a
fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense
of sharing filesystems. Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so
one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have
to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how
things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are
taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups. 

Note that the NeXT does this: you can always telnet into a NeXT and
run character-based apps but you can't run the GUI. (Yeah, I know
about X-Windows, just haven't been too impressed by it...)..

You can change it. As part of a continuously downsizing Government
organization, my code (branch) changes about once a year. I just
finished changing the registration information using Norton Utilities.
I sent the original requester the hex offset into USER.EXE containing
the information, and his reply indicated he got several similar answers.

And it's not encoded in any way. As for the legality, there's nothing
that keeps me from changing the information; it certainly doesn't reach
out and alter the serial number printed on the inside of my manual.

Subject: The Escrow Database.
Organization: Partnership for an America Free Drug
Lines: 77

Here is a disturbing thought.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in
the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database
get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were
I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow
houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)

Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of
serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but
this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the
population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for
each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very
valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who
cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my
pocket on two 8mm tapes.

Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole
database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks
in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day
by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience
will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At
some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte
tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will
doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that ""can't"" is a
prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.

With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for
every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you
need the ""master key"" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information
that have to be stored an awful lot of places.

Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database
isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial
political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the
ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the
evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have
a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial
secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why
our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left
unexplained by those that point out this threat.) 

Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA
and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened
many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some
fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.

Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on
the escrow databases.

We crypto types are all taught something very important at the
beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the
easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a
secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our
teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they
would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million
Clipper chips.

I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this
doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too
many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect
that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are
doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue
to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect
that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can
try to delay things as long as possible.

Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable
bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe
that this scheme might give people some security, even as their
subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of
it all.

This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.  If there
are no new bids then the current bids stand (like that's gonna  happen.  :) ).
After this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction 
will end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in
on  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST*
25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any
particular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of
padding).  
All dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit, 
so I've come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing 
items like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
*
Condition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as
most of the material inside is in great shape.
Excellent - IE-""As you find them in the store""
Very Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten
Good      - On down the line
Very Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still ""decent"")
Poor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by
scissors).  
A * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is 
missing (usually the insert)

Subject:    Norton Desktop Smartcan vs. Norton Util's EP
Lines: 22

I just purchased The Norton Desktop for windows, and I also have
Norton Utilities.  When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line
that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility.
It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the
version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the
Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however,
install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:
   1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.
       i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?
   2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?
       I use both dos and windows, and I want to make sure that when I
       erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected.

From the experiments I have run, The two programs (Erase Protect and
smart Erase) don't use each others info.
I currently have both EP and smartcan loading within my autoexec, and
I don't see any conflicts;

FYI :  Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.2
       Norton Util's version 6

Thanks for any help.

   As of today I will no longer be a contact for Zeos International on the net.
This responsibility has been taken over by another tech (davidm@zeos.com) and I
am moving up and on (mo money, mo money :)).  I just wanted to thank all of the
netters who have supported and encouraged the participation of Zeos on the net.
I personally feel it is important for companies such as Zeos to provide their
customers with as easy access as possible when they have questions/problems and
being on the net is an big step in the right direction.  I hope that other
companies will follow suit (as Weitek and others have done). Again, thanks.

The front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local car
stereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units 
serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I 
don't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people
who damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.

As to deterring theft:

When I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800
number.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most
people who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that
matter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
they couldn't use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial
numbers do catch theives.

Just a thought,
Michael

In the past I've managed to buy used neon sign transformers from sign shops

I run a PC with Linux (free-unix) with X11r5 and OpenWindows 3.0, I

The quotation marks should enclose ""laws,"" not ""must.""

If there were no such rules, even instinctive ones or unwritten ones,

These circuits abound in most electronic project books.  If you're more

 I apologize for posting this. I thought it was only going to talk.origins.
I also took my definitions from a 1938 Websters.
 Nonetheless, the apparent past arguments over these words imply that like
'bimonthly' and 'biweekly' they have no commonly accepted definitions and
should be used with care.

Phew! That takes a load off. I don't want to live forever.  I wish
most Christians held this view.  You can't walk across campus in
spring without being assailed by fire-and-brimstone preachers.  I
really think the metaphor should be limited, at least with respect to
teaching our children.  It's criminal to put these ideas into a young
and trusting mind.  Besides, why not rely on the positive aspects of
your religion to win their faith?

Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:

1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a ""verbatim 
translation"" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --
the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section
by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.
In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce 
the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not 
surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a 
single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi
law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, 
urban-folklore style.

2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a 
copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution 
team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't 
understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable 
to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and 
yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:

""If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons
Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of
documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German
law registry].""

Bingo.  Exactly.  

Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one
under discussion.  All of the stuff about ""Why would a U.S. congressman
have a copy of a Nazi law?"" melts away, by the author's admission.  He
then continues:  ""But if he acquired the original German text of the 
Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so 
for a very specific reason...""  But there's absolutely no reason to 
think that this is the case.  In fact, as a ""senior member of the U.S. 
team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals"", it seems to me that
he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether 
the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously
is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally
prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red 
herrings.

3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the
JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he 
asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge 
levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask 
to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd 
took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing 
it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, 
wouldn't he?
    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier
posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this
purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent
on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil
liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it
on their own?
    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his
own question: ""Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law
to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the 
Nazi law.""  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered
into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents ""concerning
the history of Nazism and gun confiscation"", Dodd's motivation isn't a 
mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.

4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that
was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  
Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT
a ""Nazi-inspired"" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the 
1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification 
of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list 
other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;
of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,
in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the 
discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, 
""Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68..."" -- so 
as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.

This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS
and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.

That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display
on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say
you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could
put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.
You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could
have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,
or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any
combination.

Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different
in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.

The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,
MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,
this is 12.

As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.
X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X
I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is
not the case.

We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of
course, I could say ""Buy all you want, we'll support more.""

Thanks for this clue, and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the
same direction.

One solution, due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up, we SetValue
its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the
previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue
first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different.
The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the
location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the
location of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the
source of the problem.)

The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:

1) Use ""twm"" or ""mwm"" rather than ""olwm""
2) Use ""olwm"", with resource ""*wmTimeout: 10""
3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.

This is obviously working around some bug somewhere.

Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator? There are a few Unix versions

One for Mach (NeXT) and for Irix (SGI). There may be others, such
as for Sun SparcStation, but I don't know for sure.

	No, no no. The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much
like the pod people from planet Mars, who can take on any form (the
ability remains the same, however). The Ack-people have been spotted on
many teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentioned
above) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner and
Rojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughed
up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his
system rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact
the authorities! This evil plot must be stopped! (the Ack-people can
keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman, though. I enjoy watching Toronto fans
suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal ;-)

Following precedent in other areas, the government is likely to put a tax on
encryption technology.  Once the tax is imposed, it becomes a federal matter
and suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the BATF or
FBI tossing grenades into your house.  (The BATF appears to be the logical
agency to enforce such regulations: federal control over alocohol, tobacco,
and firearms is similary based on taxes.)

Look at the FCC: they won't allow sale of any receiever that can receive
bands that are supposed to be private.  This has nothing to do with any
desire to prevent harmful interference. If the government can make a radio
receiver illegal what makes you think they won't claim the right to control
encryption?

If you bought your IDE drive from a dealer, you shouldn 't have to 
perform a low level format. Even if the 1st HD is already partitioned
into C and D, FDISK will automatically assign the 2 nd HD to D and 
change the 2nd partition of 1st drive to E.

So, it's okay to use civilians for cover if you're attacking soldiers
in your country.  (Of course, many of those attacking claim that they
aren't Lebanese, so it's not their country.)

Got it.  I think.  Hmm.  This is confusing.

Could you perhaps repeat your rules explaining exactly when it is

 I think you can do this with REGEDIT, which can make changes
to the OLE registration database.  From Program Manager (or 
File Manager) choose RUN and type REGEDIT.  You do have it-
its included with Windows, but not well documented.

Replying to A.J. Teel:

	Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the
	Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for
	stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a
	while now.

Humbug.  Those letters don't provide ""concrete proof"" of anything at all
in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-
ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.

Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that
income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to
pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-
out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This
issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect
something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of
federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).

Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material
""concrete proof"".

	There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers
	finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their
	reasons for disbelief at this point.

Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've
posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to
believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem
on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I
feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments
have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such
strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are
applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal
to the Supreme Court.

Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular
employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay
his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-
sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court
with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally
voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why
not; why haven't you?

	Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the
	opposition has forfeited the field?

With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,
for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of
authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-
ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.

For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would
be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you
told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big
banking interests since the 1938 ""admiralty jurisdiction"" coverup thing.
Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble
to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into
their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right
combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?

Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?
Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US
officials to classify you as a ""14th Amendment federal citizen""?  When
the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell
them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,
D.C., where they belong?

Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you
suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.
If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just
declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads
with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet
can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with
plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).

Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this
garbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-
ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in
jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.

Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current
employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to
care too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a ""14th Amend-
ment federal citizen"", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep
on filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably
not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion
and/or the foreign tax credit).

Hi.  I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra
900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem
on his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would be
greatly appreciated.

When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types
of sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH
speakers:

system beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)

Armor Alley
Spectre
Spaceward Ho!


But, the following games only play out of the left channel:

Lemmings
Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
Glider 4.0
OIDS


But still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers.
(The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which
my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))


All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run
OOTW because he doesn't have color).

We're both running system 7.1



Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get
sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or
greater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?

I used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in
stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be
mistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB
170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there
isn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are
apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they
could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of
both speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?

Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge),
so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1
patch over this problem?)




Thanks for any help you can provide!

Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for
Kansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having
played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the
4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.

Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite
accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,
which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because
he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which
point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and
he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not
reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as
injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped
him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly
not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a
no-no).

Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was
hurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably
another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of
his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players
motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a
bad judgement call.


>#20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4th

Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but
hustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me
one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to
hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's
neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned
around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter
wasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.

The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie
McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me
""you have to make room for the kids"". Carter, in fact, refused to report to
K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto
retirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey
now is the Gulls.

Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked
fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he
was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.

> He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.

Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you
wish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you
can really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have
trouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and
my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)

You? Nah... 

He was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as
few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate
to judge the talent too quickly. Butn in Dody's case, I""m tempted to make an
exception.

But I won't.

Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into 
server resident Pixmap(s) using XPutImage.  Once this is done, the original XImages
can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable.

If you are interested in a program which is very easy to use, I strongly 
suggest Approach 2.0.  It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I
own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to 
build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have
heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic.
Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/
home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I 
have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily:
I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must 
be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to 
use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records 
appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order)
exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach 
database), and then copying the exported files back to the original 
filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really 
like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than 
the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also 
takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).

If the data isn't there when the warrant comes, you effectively have
secure crypto.  If secret backups are kept...then you effectively have
no crypto.  Thus, this poster is essentialy arguing no crypto is better
than secure crypto.

If the data isn't there when the warrant comes, then the government will
just have to use normal law enforcement techniques to catch crooks.  Is
this so bad?   BTW, bugging isn't YET a normal law enforcement technique.
With the privacy clipper, it WILL become a normal technique.

I'm looking for a database called ""Micro World Data Bank II"", a database
with digital map information containing 178,068 latitude, longitude points.
It is said to be in the public domain. If anyone knows a place where I can
get it (preferably FTP/gopher/mailserver etc.; otherwise snail mail) please
let me know. I you have it yourself and are willing to send me the file,
drop me a line.

I'll be using it with a program called VERSAMAP by Charles H. Culberson.
If anyone knows of another detailed database that can be used with this
program (preferably PD), I would be very interested.

Replies by e-mail please, directly to me, I don't read this group regularly.
If there's interest I'll post a summary, of course.

Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic

act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to

uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to

Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see
why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors
converted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a
Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing.

Seeing as how people are willing to quote the FBI quoting cultists

Maybe true, partly true, or false.

   In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied

   disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich
   or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed 
   solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.

I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is
not terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.

   [snip]
   imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like 
   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....

I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are ""terrorist
camps"".  There are however some which come very close to serving that
purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way
prior to the invasion. 

   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of
   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not 
   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often
   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are
   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and
   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they
   are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where
   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.

Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you
describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,
backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah
and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,
while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate
bombing, which would have produced major casualties.

   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that
   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance
   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING 
   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real 
   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.

Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if
the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police
it and prevent further attacks.

   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to
   realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting
   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more
   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
   would have resulted in.  

Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no
longer civilian and now primarily military though.

   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such 
   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
   in all other parts of Lebanon.

No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another
Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.

   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing
   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.

You misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about

""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,
not a Muslim.

Regarding Bernard Lewis:

Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his
giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.

Read ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.

In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).

I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and
have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his
political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic
polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based
on telling half-truths.

Again, read ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take
what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get
this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for
_yourself_.

If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some

purposes is necessarily opposed too.

I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_
who are not getting through to _you_.

Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.

Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,
showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been
completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a
very good one, under the title ""Islam and Women"", reposted from
soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,
then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this
excellent article.  

IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.

Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,
which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based
completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and
hadiths to support its point of view.

Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical
standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an
and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform
a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is
part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of
course not.

Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for
you.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says ""I am a
Muslim"" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean
that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and
only an idiot would think so.

Do you see my point?

You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an
ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise
their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.
To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --
Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be
capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a
free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of 
capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)

>When this stopped,
>you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour.
>No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education

One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is
because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.

Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the
fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that
Islam => lack of education and power.

For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a
significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in
the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is
completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history
shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be
other reasons for this situation.

>You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims 
>for following the Quran. 

Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent
of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not
knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are
following the Qur'an or not.

>Your idea is baseless from historical
>facts, it is a poor utopia, 

The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one
stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by ""following the Qur'an""
that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis
that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical
fact which contradicts your theory. 

>while my ideas are derived from social
>and economic history. 

You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.
So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is
quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views
makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of
this.

>My solution to all Muslims is simple:
>CUT THE CRAP, 

I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.

>GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT 

Here too.

>AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE
>THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.

Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate
ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly
with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I
think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!

Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that
you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start
thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our
postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously
have.

Two questions:

1)  You asserted that both the AR-15 and AK-47 are not suitable for
   ""real hunting"".  If you have no problem with hunting, or using
   self loading rifles for hunting, why did you say this?  If not
   for deer, then what about other, smaller game?

2)  When did I get the nickname ""NRA man""?  Notice I have never referred
   to you as ""Janette"" which you don't seem to like.  Do I get any
   super-powers, like Spider Man or Powdered Toast Man?

No, sorry your wrong again. *You* quoted the del Sol as doing 0-60 in

If you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:

  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?

Do you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn
will run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your
222hp sports car is so easily beaten. 

A Mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers),
has less power and is much quicker? Care to explain. Don't be abusive,
just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp
went to, its a mystery to me.

The subject-line says it:  every time I run a fever, I get an amazing
rosy rash over my torso and arms.  Fortunately, it doesn't itch.

The rash  always comes on the day after the
fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold, flu, whatever.
It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current
town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.

Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever:
a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever
seems to bring rashes that go away faster.  

Anybody know what might be causing this?  It's no more than an 
embarassment, but I'd be curious to know what's going on.  Am I carrying
some kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out
its competition?

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime.
That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you
want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the
only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who
witnesses a crime can do so.

Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a
description of the car and the license number, and tell them the
specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
(ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill
out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any
ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to
appear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight
as a cop's.

     It's not the NRA's fault; but it is something to consider if you are
considering contributing to the NRA. If candidate B is a complete asshole
whose only saving grace is that he opposes unnecessary restrictions on
firearms, I wouldn't want my membership dues funding efforts to get him

     I have other problems with the NRA (as an organization; the individual

definitely pro-hunting, and I recall seeing a pro-Desert Storm NRA bumper
sticker. Sometimes they come on too strong in the political arena, which
contributes to their reputation as ""bad guys"" amoung many people.

I am looking for a commercial/PD graphics editor with fairly limited
abilities that runs under X and preferably uses Motif widgets. It must
run on HP-UX version 9, either with or without the PEX extension. The
sort of things I want are simple drawing, resizing and moving of objects
such as lines, rectangles and text. Bounding rectangle operations are
sufficient for object selection. Ideally it should also allow the
creation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g.
text entry fields or labels), but this is not mandatory.

Does anyone have such an animal? If you do, please mail me with details
including price (especially run-time licensing since it must be

I'm a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230
([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems.
Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down
unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During
this time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away
(For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged
configuration.

He's re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of these
have helped. 

It's possible that it's network-related, he uses Eudora which checks his
email every 10 minutes (over Ethernet). He hasn't checked to see if this
problem occurs while undocked (he's docked most of the time). 

Little to no non-Apple inits, I don't want to start yanking the rest
unless I know that might *really* be the problem. 

He hasn't tried zapping the PRAM, I have advised him to do that next.

Anyone who has ideas, I'd love to hear about them. I'd call Apple, but
I've found they're best to call during the week (it's Sunday evening).

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or
GlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it
allows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink,
glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.

The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.

I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but
that's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.

  Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since
respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This
doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in
the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.

  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like
it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,
and isn't.  
  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has
forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement.
  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of
oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to
live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ 
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great
deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the 
male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.
  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great
ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings
and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long
tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  
Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism
is an attractive option.
  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)
should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.

Are there any graphics cards for the SE/30 that also have, say, an 040

the _SE_, but none (that I've seen) for the SE/30.

Every time you read about a shuttle landing they mention the double sonic  
booms.  Having taken various relevant classes, I have several ideas of where  
they come from, but none of them are very convincing.  Exactly what causes  
them?  Are they a one time pheneomenon, or a constant one like the supersonic  
shockwave that is constantly produced by a plane, but you hear only when it  
goes over you?

The first means that some aspect of reality contains objective values.
The second means that values are a reference to some preference of the

Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto ?
------------------------------------

While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they
repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
attempt to starve the Gazans.

The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.
The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel.

While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the
Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to
rise up against its tormentors.

As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of
Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are
considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops
and fields. Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in
Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for
the Master Race.

The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the
right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the
occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some
Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over
Gaza through Arab collaborators.

As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible
with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming
Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish
society does not consider Gazans full human beings. This attitude
is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. The
current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are
consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister
Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. One is led to ask
oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister
goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution
up their sleeve ?

I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and
political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.

You might try the recorder and make a micro.  I done that to do certain operations

Dear Folks:

It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program, 
Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library
that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite
multimedia objects to be built from media objects.

Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available
in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the
source code for the original classes (though several configuration
files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). 
 
Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN
workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.

Xavier has been tested in the following environments:

SUN:
  Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC
  OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later
  C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1

NEC(EWS):
  Machine : EWS4800/210,230
  OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2
  C++     : C++ Release3.1

It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from 

         interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/
          (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)

We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.
If you are interested, please contact
               
                   xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp. 

I will add your e-mail address to our list.

It was the Harry Reams of TTL. One ultra-tiny power line glitch, one

They are working ok, but your definitions in QVTNET.INI and QVTHOST.RC are
incorrect (see below).

No, I don't think so. You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently, aren't
you? They use different packet types, so QVTNET (TCP/IP) and NOVELL (IPX/SPX)
should be able to coexist just fine. PKTMUX is required if you are using
different TCP/IP-Packages concurrently.

>This is the qvthost.rc file.

There is the first problem: You didn't specify hostnames, just IP-Addresses.
Your file should look like this:

137.112.5.2        <Name of your Nameserver>
137.112.199.50     <Name of your Router>

>This is the beginning of the winqvt.ini file.
>[net]
>name=swartzjh.test.rose-hulman.edu

Here you should only specify your hostname, without the domain part.

>router=137.112.199.50

Instead, use router=<Name of your Router>, as specified in your QVTHOST.RC
I know the release notes for 3.31 say that IP addresses should work also,
but  apparently they don't.

>nameserver=137.112.5.2

Here, too, you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the
IP address.

It worked fine for me that way, although I could not specify more than
one nameserver. The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to
three nameservers, separated by commas, but it didn't work.

Hope it helps,
Richard

Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe
that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would
not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent
the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.
And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that 
would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank
goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine
that helps me.  

I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you
would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second
opinion, and then move on with your life.
Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in 
this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.
These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over
the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going
to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was 
helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very
unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,
make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.

A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what
I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not
a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are
only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us
out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing
piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.

I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things
that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,
or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because 
those things are much more tangible and have much more concise 
definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to
decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to
find your way out of it.


I have chosen the latter.

   I've been following discussions about the Delta Clipper program, and I
have one small question.  As I understand it, the DC-X derived orbital
vehicle (DC-Y & 1) is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, not
completely nose-first.  So why is the DC-Y look symmetric in every drawing
I've seen?  I would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like 
wingless Orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on the
top side.  Can anybody explain?

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking:  what distinguishes
""true"" religion from cults (I'm speaking generally here, not specifially
about Christianity)?  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on 
Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that
true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person.
But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity
IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the
Branch Davidian ""cult"" from the Presbyterian ""church""?  Doctrinal
differences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as
an answer.

[There have been some attempts to characterize ""cult"".  Most commonly
it uses characteristics involving high pressure, brainwashing

error.  In the end I'm afraid it becomes a term with no precise
meaning that's used primarily to dismiss groups as not worthy
of serious consideration.  That doesn't mean that there aren't
groups that do highly irresponsible things and have serious
doctrinal errors.  But past discussions have not suggested to me
that ""cult"" is a very helpful term.  --clh]

Re: Problems with S3-initialization

As described the manual the following steps must be done for th initialization
of the S3 card.

InitDisplay;
	(*BIOS-Call

		with BX-Reg = 105H for 1024 x 768 x 256 resolution

Unlock Graphic Command Group (CR40)
	(* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Syst. Configuration Register *)
Unlock Advanced Display Functions
	(* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Function Control Register *)

After these operations the FIFO-stack of the S3 should be empty.
When we watch the status (Graph. Proc. Status), we always get
the value 0FH instead of 0H.
Full would mean 0FFH (8 places occupied), empty would mean 0H
(0 places occupied).

It is possible to read this register in two different ways. 
Both times we get different results.

Why use a ground launch pad. It is entirely posible to launch from altitude.
This was what the Shuttle was originally intended to do! It might be seriously

   Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest

   If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours, your
fixation on Israel must stop.  You might have to start asking the
same sort of questions of Arab countries as well.  You realize it
would not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the

begin to look like the biased attack that it is.

   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for

who hates Israel.

   Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel?  I
have heard that your family once lived in Israel, but the members
of your family could not cut the competition there.  Is this true
about your family?  Is this true about you?  Is this actually not
about Israel, but is really a personal vendetta?  Why are you not
the least bit objective about Israel?  Do you think that the name
of your phony-baloney center hides your bias in the least?  Get a

truth?  Haven't you realized that you are in over your head?  The
people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or
need them to be.  This is not the place for such pseudo-analysis.
You will be continually ripped to shreds, until you start to show
some regard for objectivity.  Or you can continue to show what an
anti-Israel zealot you are, trying to disguise your bias behind a
pompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research.'  You ought to
know that you are a laughing stock, your 'Center' is considered a
joke, and until you either go away, or make at least some attempt
to be objective, you will have a place of honor among the clowns,

hmm... not that I am an authority on RISC ;-) but I clearly remember

The difference is in addressing modes - RISC instruction sets are not

If your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a

Ok I will do this V E R Y  S L O W L Y so you can understand
REGUARDLESS of whether it is a Mac or a PC SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 are DIFFERENT
from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous SCSI-1.  All of these
have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS. Lumping them all together as 'SCSI' is

Already GAVE them.  YOU keep deleting them! So here are the Specs
on everybody AGAIN {With some added info}:

SCSI-1 {SCSI-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3MB/s
 synchronous range: 0-5MB/s  Both common to the PC world; difference is
 mainly in software not hardware.

SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip; also called SCSI-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6MB/s with 
10MB/s burst.  This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the
 PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.}

{I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
>IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                          
 asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}

Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true

With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with
SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.}
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: 
(My comments in {})
""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with
a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."" {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with 
a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29
The ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use
NOT because the interface itself is a mess.

SCSI means ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2""
NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.

To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the 
speed of IDE...""
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2}.  Lumping
everything into SCSI as SCSI-1 is SLOPPY, WRONG, and DUMB.  Inconsitant
SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 usage is also a problem.  Clean it up now or have
a mess like SVGA was several years ago because everybody and his Uncle
slapped 'SCSA' an their own monitor inteface {SCSI IS standarized unlike
SVGA was years ago EXCEPT in terminaology.}

These don't seem like ""little things"" to me.  At least, they are orders

Answer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -> a = 1760

Corollary: Armenians strike, slaughter, destroy, and massacre. After all,
           they are not as innocent as the asala network claims.

Come on!  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war 
against Israel.  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations.  That is
the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals
only a few years ago.

All of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti-
Israel activity or propoganda.  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if
anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.

>>2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ?

No, that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel (aside from
the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa (
Palestinian whose American group planned to bow up the Israeli Embassy and 
""kill many Jews."") are caught.  As Mordechai Levy of the JDL said, Paranoid
Jews live longer.

Subject: Version control for MAC and PC LAN
Organization: Prodigy Services Co.
Lines: 28

We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. 
For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has   
always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a      
filter to strip out the <LF> characters.                                        

Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as   
a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together   
at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying  
to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will  
allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                            

I understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC 
product (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).                                       

I have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms, so I assume that
ours is not a new problem.  Who has had to deal with it ?  What solutions have  
you come up with?

Summary: Clipping of character's high order bit
Nntp-Posting-Host: hsi86.hsi.com
Organization: 3M Health Information Systems, Wallingford CT
Lines: 38

I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being 
clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. I have reprogrammed
the F1 key to transmit a <ff> <be> character sequence by using the
following line in .Xdefaults:

~Ctrl ~Shift ~Alt <Key> F1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \n\

I merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm
which has the remapped F1 key. The problem that arises is that the 
application which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f> <3e>
sequence, which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each
character being filtered or ignored.

When I run xev and press the F1 key, I get the correct value showing 
up in the following two key events:

  KeyPress event, serial 14, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,
  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104),

  state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,
  XLookupString gives 0 characters:  """"

Notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe.
But when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to 
spit back the hex values of keyboard input, I only get <7f> <3e>.

Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what
I can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to
the final application? Any help is greatly appreciated.

Please *email* any responses.

Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith

                           WEIRD SCIENCE

Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips 
move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are 
politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase 
""political science"" is subject to more than one interpretation.  

Years ago, we heard how ""scientists"" were worried that a new Ice 
Age might be coming, and later on that ""nuclear winter"" -- smoke 
and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international 
unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even 
have killed the dinosaurs.  

What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, 
that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended 
to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken 
values that made America the most successful culture in history, 
and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague 
when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  

We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William 
Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't 
supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least 
100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never 
know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit 
their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and 
that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  

But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of 
science as they are of everything, they trust ""scientists"" to 
unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's ""scientists"" 
have agendas of their own.  

Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is 
going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that 
there is no respectable evidence for ""global warming"".  The money 
and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and 
they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical 
crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  

The same appears true of ""acid rain"", a deliberate hoax cooked up 
by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private 
industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and 
foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on 
specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  

The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  
""Ozone depletion"", for which evidence is even more suspect and 
contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than 
a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era 
when state central planning and the command economy have failed and 
can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  

Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth 
and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear 
power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy 
known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount 
of energy there is available to any individual in society, the 
freer that individual -- and his society -- become.  

Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and 
self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as 
ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive 
reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have 
been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  

And what the media didn't say about recent EPA ""discoveries"" on the 
effect of ""secondhand smoking"" is that, although some harm to non-
smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of 
magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a 
week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether 
there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  

That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically 
correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice 
to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy 
practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's 
science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is 
highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet 
the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There 
isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of 
government money on the scientific establishment.  

Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies 
to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one 
time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and 
religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has 
tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of 
abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street 
-- has wound up being shed.  

Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's 
lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of 
livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, 
to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels 
for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, 
when they die from the effects of obesity.  

What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two 
more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of 
state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; 
real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will 
simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and 
everyone will benefit.

YESSS!  You make me proud to
be an 'Merkun.  Good thing you
didn't get shot though. Don't
try that with a good'ole boy in Texas.
I once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off (I was 
in my car) after I had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic
and senseless.  All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks
back (he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since the
freeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, ""Stick that
finger out again and I'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your
sorry-ass throat.""  I stared straight ahead, unblinking.  A hundred
cars were honking.  Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red
with anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him, 
waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...  I'm glad he decided 
not to shoot me.

I am glad that I am not an atheist.  It seems tragic that some people 
choose a meaningless existence.  How terrible to go on living only 
because one fears death more than life.  I feel so sorry for Eric and 
yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as 
further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity.    

As a Christian I am free to be a human person.  I think, love, choose, 
and create.  I will live forever with God.

Christ is not a kind of drug.  Drugs are a replacement for Christ.  
Those who have an empty spot in the God-shaped hole in their hearts must 
do something to ease the pain.  This is why the most effective 
substance-abuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples' spiritual 
needs.

Thank you, Eric for your post.  It has helped me to appreciate how much 
God has blessed me.  I hope that you will someday have a more joy-filled 
and abundant life.

I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs, biggest
surprises, and biggest disappointments this year. Now, these are just
my observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an
opportunity to see all the teams the same amount. Anyway....
  
MVP = most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and
      in terms of leadership (""can't win without him"")
  
Biggest surprise = the player who rose above expectation -- the player
      that may have raised the level of his game to a new height, even
      if that new level doesn't necessarily warrant an allstar berth
      (includes those players who at the outset of the season, may not
      even have been in the team's plans).
   
Biggest disappointment = the player from whom we expected more (e.g., I
      picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on
      offence brought by Demers, shouldn't Savard have done better?)

   It was good to see the Wings play, but lets not give ESPN too much credit.
There weren't any other late baseball games on so they didn't have another

I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently.
Usually, the line at the bottom of the FileManager (the status bar, I
guess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for
the current selection.  If I select a whole bunch of files, I will get
an exact byte count.

Recently, I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating!
If I select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'.
If I select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes', 
not 23 Kbytes, just 23 bytes!  If I select 893,352 it will report only
893 bytes in the selection.  If I select over a Meg worth of files, say
3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes!  It's as if it's got a problem with displaying
more than 3 characters!

My system: 486DX/33, 8M memory, Stacker 3.0, DOS 5, Win 3.1.  I've run
the latest virus scanners (scan102, f-prot) and they didn't report anything.
Could I have unknowingly altered something that controls the formatting
of the status bar in the FileManger?

The problem is with ISA bus-masters which
can only address the first 16MBs of system
memory.  Bus-masters do not use the CPU
nor the system DMA to do the actual data
transfer but transfer their data directly
to the system RAM.

(please respond via email!)

Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not
having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with
O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.

The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because
XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does
(which makes no sense to me).

The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the
mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So
you can't actually edit any colors.

We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around 
in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have 
no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the 
above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail 
for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have.

Any hints?

Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

Bobby-

A few posts ago you said that Lucifer had no free will.  From the above
it seems the JW believes the contrary.

Are you talking about the same Lucifer?

If so, can you suggest an experiment to determine which of you is wrong?

Or do you claim that you are both right?

I am familiar with inductive logic.  Go ahead and give me the details
of the ""logic"" that led you to conclude, incorrectly, that I would
condone Robert Weiss taking verses out of context.  Your conclusion was
wrong, of course, since I agree that both you and Robert Weiss were
guity of taking verses out of context.  Nothing hypocritical about
that, is there?  

Since you reached a false conclusion, you made some mistake in your
""logic.""  The only question is where.  Did you think that it would
be hypocritical for me not to post a reply to Robert Weiss' articles?
Did you make the common creationist error of confusing a lack of
evidence for X with evidence for the lack of X?   Is your grasp of
inductive logic not quite as firm as you think? See if you can figure
out what your mistake was, and learn from it.

Well, I think that most Christians believe that your conciousness will

Hi all,

  I would like to purchase CD-ROM drive. The specs I would like to have is:

   * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD
   * SCSI(2) Interface
   * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B
   * Does not need any caddies
   * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible)
   * Double Speeded

  I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition,
  so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions
  are sorted by my priority.
  I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it DOES satisfy
  almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know
  the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these
  NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible
  with 1542B adapter.
  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

When the utility gave up on that Cinnci, OH plant (Zimmer?) and

Article in this morning's Houston Post....""negotiators send food to

riot where they have killed at least one of the hostage guards.

I know it's not the same ""group"" but the mindset appears to be common to
""those what rule"" here lately....they won't give diddley to the BD's in Waco
but they treat criminals as deserving of ""humanitarian gestures"".

This is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy more
priviliges in today's society than their victims or other law abiding
citizens. What is it that makes the criminal so precious to the ""leaders of
the system""?

Could it be that the criminal is one of the ""tools"" the ""authorities"" are
using to ""excuse"" some of the rights negation they are trying to foist upon
the law abiding citizen in the name of crime control....don't solve the crime
problem because then the citizen couldn't be held hostage to ""our help"".

If the crime problem were solved in favor of the citizen/victim at the
expense of the criminal none of the crap such as RICO and gun banning could
be used as excuses to work the agenda of those who would control our every
move and thought.

I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works
very well.  That's not my point.  I'm >philosophically< opposed to it
because of its complexity.

This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making
some very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF
images (though they'll save them, of course), and a general
inability to interchange images between different environments
despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.

As the saying goes, ""It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the
>other<  assholes out there!""  I've had big trouble with misuse and
abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and
unnecessary) complexity of the format.

In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized
emphasis mine):

""The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed
to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a
fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in
this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),
and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be
able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many
image-generating applications out there now.""


If a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF
image, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to
deal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I
don't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not
that anyone does, of course! :-)

Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,
on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.
 If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a
different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,
that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I
would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.

   Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S.
government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative.
For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and
another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially
the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the
police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court-
issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped
messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could
generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be
willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the
alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd
probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).
   This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information
on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there
would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.
(Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct
me, but this doesn't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcement
capabilities.)

This isn't exactly audio, but take a look in ""RF Design"" magazine,
April 93, for the article ""A Robust Signaling Technique for Part 15
RF Control Netowrk Applications.""  Page 29.  Sources of parts are
mentioned; in the same issue is an article that features a chipset
for the Digital European Cordless Telecommunications standard.

I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re:
performance. Where do they get those numbers? I'll list the actual
performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a
statement is absurd:

SCSI-I ranges from 0-5MB/s.
SCSI-II ranges from 0-40MB/s.
IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.
ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)

	Indeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not
	as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  One problem is
	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the
	sample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  According to Teitz,

	As stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 
	percent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect
	whole blood levels, however.  I don't believe there is a well-
	defined ""conversion factor,"" since cell metabolism will affect

One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions
is called _Man's Religions_ by John B. Noss.  It was a textbook in a class
I had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decent
bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.

It doesn't ""compare"" religions directly but describes each one individually
and notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even
remotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianity
mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book is
divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began 
(India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religions
from the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill each
other over nowadays.  And a few of the older religions snuffed out along
the way.  

If you like the old stuff, then a couple of books called ""The Ancient Near
East"" by James B. Pritchard are pretty cool.  Got the Epic of Gilgamesh,
Code of Hammurabi, all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods
were men.  Essential reading for anyone who wishes to make up their own
religion and make it sound real good.

First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors,
transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla
coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean
an ""air core resonant transformer"". The TV flyback version Tesla
coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for
diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called
""Oscillating Shuttle Circuit"" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly
efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,
which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active
reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve
efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core
resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI
for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer
screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil
from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all
Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter
and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind
to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,
gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and
telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????

GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE
TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!

If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.

That is an idea.. The most efficient moon habitat.. 

also the idea of how to get the people off the moon once the prize was won..

Also the idea of how to rescue someone who is ""dying"" on the moon.

Maybe have a area where they can all ""see"" each other, and can help each other
if something happens.. 

I liek the idea of one prize for the first moon landing and return, by a
non-governmental body..

Also the idea of then having a moon habitat race.. 

I know we need to do somthing to get people involved..

Eccentric millionaire/billionaire would be nice.. We see how old Ross feels
about it.. After all it would be a great promotional thing and a way to show he
does care about commericalization and the people.. Will try to broach the
subject to him.. 

Moonbase on the cheap is a good idea.. NASA and friends seem to take to much
time and give us to expensive stuff that of late does not work (hubble and
such). Basically what is the difference between a $1mil peice of junk and a

Hmmm.  Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means
third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting
a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 
21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.
Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or
a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are
wrong.

By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad
prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as
California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally 
stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, 
but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,
willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was
terribly upset about this.

I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a
clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering
a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
doesn't have a grain of truth to it.

Lack of build quality was the thing  I notced on the first 2 LH's I
saw months back. The panel gaps were large and non-uniform between
the 2 cars I saw - the kind of thing you expect and accept on a
Mustang - but not from Chrysler's savior.  I drove one of the low

an LH to a Taurus from my brief experience.

Ahhh, of course. Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events 
like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those 
TWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline
bombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of 
Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any
bags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be 
bombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah,
those wonderful ""mainstream moderates"" with whom Israel is attempting
to negotiate.

Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians
than by Israelis.  Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads.
I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary 
_Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather 
inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to ""the cause"" of
whichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someone
else, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death-
squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic
on the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my 
favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back 
the execution of a ""collaborator?""  3 photos:
1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint.
2) The ""collaborator"" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple.
3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the ""collaborator
shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.

Wonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights.

If Brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the
encryption algorithm is being kept secret.  This will prevent competitors
from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government-
installed ""back door.""  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long
as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government
chips.

(It would be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if Brad
turns out to be right.  As long as people still have the power to provide
their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper, privacy
is still possible.  But the wording of several passages in the announcement
makes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true.)

""All"" is a *very* big number.  The AT&T Long Distance network has
around 20,000 T3 trunks (45 Mbit/sec), which is on the order of 10**12 bits/sec.
That doesn't even count the amount of traffic in the LOCAL phone companies,
or our long-distance competitors.  It's about 200 Exabytes tapes / second,
which is pretty large even for the NSA :-)

On the other hand, I can easily see them recording the traffic for
""interesting"" people, such as dissidents, suspected criminals,
foreign telephone calls, and anybody noticed using encryption.
As Ken Shiriff speculates, recording encrypted traffic will probably
be judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon ....

There is a whole constellation of custom built navigation beacon satellites
in the process of being phased out right now. The TRANSIT/OSCAR satellites
are being replaced by GPS. Or were you thinking of deep space navigation,
which is best done with doppler/VLBI/ stellar measurements. I do not think
additional radio beacons would help much.

Is their a pd/freeware hard drive utility that can handle

Need to document occasional failures in reading/writing,

I believe that all of my problems with DOS/Windows can
be isolated to my drive.  Getting occasional corrupted

Had these problems under DOS 5.  Only with drive C.
Drive D may have had one failure, but that file was
under the control of Win/Winword on drive C.

All utilities available to me report no problems.
DOS, NDD (NU4.5).  Another symptom, SD took forever

For some reason I never saw the original post on this thread, but if you are
looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a PC, you really can't go past
the mode X stuff from Dr Dobbs. This code is all p.domain (as far as I know),
and in the original articles, the routines were all presented as dumb vga
routines, and then optimised to modeX with some interesting discussion along
the way.
If you are interested, I could find out more details of the issues in question,

ABOUT THIS POSTING
------------------
This is a (still rather rough) listing of likely questions and
information about RIPEM, a program for public key mail encryption.  It
(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc
VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a
variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific
to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.

This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply
with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy
manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know
what you think.

DISCLAIMER
----------
Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything
other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk
to a real lawyer.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
---------------------

1)  What is RIPEM?

 RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using
 the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your
 electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who
 sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except
 the intended recipient.)

 RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.
 Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,
 which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.

2)  How can I get RIPEM?

 RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is
 considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution
 to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or
 Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README
 file:

 #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution
 #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,
 #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.

 Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is
 included with the distribution.  You should read it before using
 RIPEM.

 The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will
 reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the
 humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the
 friend.

 RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents
 in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for
 info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and
 does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.

 RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on
 rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the
 U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out
 how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file
 GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are
 available here in addition to the full source tree.

3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?

 Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of
 Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to
 Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice
 Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports
 are expected, and help of users is invited.

4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?

 Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
 on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users
 guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM
 with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.
 Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU
 Emacs.

 If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one
 in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,
 and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.

5)  What is RSA?

 RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means
 that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to
 decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,
 you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your
 decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public
 key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to
 decrypt it.  (Note that the ""message"" sent with RSA is normally just
 the DES key to the real message. (See ""What is DES?"")

 Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,
 the fingerprint of the message (See ""What is a fingerprint, like
 MD5?"") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can
 use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message
 must have come from the sender.

 RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who
 invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in
 pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.

6)  What is DES?

 DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or
 secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to
 encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.

 RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts
 your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the
 recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,
 allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.

 DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
 key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it
 should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
 corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future
 RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using
 multiple encryption with DES.

7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?

 PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of
 encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these
 documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.

 RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM
 specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not
 handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.

8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?

 For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know
 your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message
 received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important
 that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that
 his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.

 RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,
 the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are
 described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.
 None of them provide perfect security.

9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?

 RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various
 characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in
 your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.
 This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the
 same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the
 same length, etc.

10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?

 MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.
 It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,
 of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not
 possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a
 different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,
 instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,
 only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.

 MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often
 used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a
 passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.

 MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in
 RFC 1321.

11)  What is PGP?

 PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.
 PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.
 PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.

 Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:

 - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without
   a direct network connection.

 - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of
   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible
   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with
   PGP 2.0.)

 - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security
   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.
   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,
   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims
   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in
   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original
   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:

   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, 
   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public
   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is
   #contraband.  

 - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside
   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites
   in Europe and other places.

 Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is
 recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.

 Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export
 restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it
 shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents
 differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably
 seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in
 misc.legal.computing.  (See:  ""DISCLAIMER"")

12)  What about RPEM?

 RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,
 but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in
 an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark
 Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.

 Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many
 (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent
 was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested
 in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.
 This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not
 challenged for pragmatic reasons.

 RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.

13)  What is MIME?

 MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is
 described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup
 comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely
 clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type
 application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I
 hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on
 the matter.

14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...

 You may wish to check the companion post ""ripem-attacks"" which
 discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and
 what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main ""weak area"" is
 probably key distribution.

Well, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They
make reference to several scandals that occurred long before ""the night of the
long knives"". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of
the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name
escapes me at the moment) called ""Homosexuals in History"" asserts that Roehm
and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.

>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,
>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and
>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. 

Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,
look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not
have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of
documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the ""knight of the
long knives"" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping
together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's
homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've 
read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. 

>(Irving, a
>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance
>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)

I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do
you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have
read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that 
all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about 
homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they 
would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?
I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one 
should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. 

>I challenge anyone to document this claim.

If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),
then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where
the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to
archival material - most people on the net are not.

>I *have* found a great
>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the
>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,
>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.

Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so
that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis
might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is
true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?

I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were
homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious
for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German
govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends
were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long
tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -
back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a 
product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the
English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,
would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.

In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The
Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various 
pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote 
homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So 
it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, 
regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the ""evils"" of homosexuality.
Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all 
societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.

No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you
will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access 
to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern
homosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is
stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove
otherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.

I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application ( namely
MicroSoft Project ). The original system ran on the PC. Now it needs to
be expanded to allow UNIX users to work with the application. The
current proposal is to use DESQview/X as a display server for the
application.

I would like to know your experiences with using DESQview/X to run an
application on a PC and displaying on a SPARCstation. I've heard that
the network traffic is slow.

Replies only by e-mail please.

Thanks, in advance.

        Remember - it's still early. Look for his offense to tail off, and his
defense to improve (hopefully). He has that rep because I heard that either
last year, or over the last 5 years, or something like that - he has the third
highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops - behind C.R. and
Tony (I'm not gonna help this sorry Mets team at all) Fernandez. I do agree
though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far.

Now there's a good idea ! All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes, and
a good (wetware) memory (was I using wp or autocad or ...). I thought of the
same idea myself a few days ago. I've got a fairly new car battery that I take
along in my 4x4 when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home.
I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy
duty 5-volt regulator to supply the PC. But I guess you'd need -5v and -12v 
(and +12) too (2 more batteries ?).

An alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery
and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the power
goes out, voi-la ! the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery ! and
then I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips !-)

I'd love to know how ""Jesus only"" proponents would answer questions like:

-Who is this ""Father"" Jesus keeps referring to? Why does He call Himself ""the
Son""?

-Why does He pray to the Father, and not to himself?

-Why does He emphasize that he does his Father's will, and not his own?  If He
 was doing his own will, what kind of example is that?  Should we follow it?

-When He says he has to return to the Father, who is He going to?

-When He says he does this in order that the Comforter, the Holy Spirit might
 come, who might that be?

-If He claims that the coming of the Holy Spirit is such a blessing that it's
 worth His leaving us and returning to the Father, what can that mean if there
 is no Holy Spirit?

-Why doesn't the best known Christian prayer begin ""Our Saviour, who art in
 heaven,"" rather than ""Our Father?""

Do they have answers to these questions that are even plausible?

(Further entertaining queries are left as an exercise to the reader.)

[There may be some misunderstanding over terms here.  I believe ""Jesus
only"" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who
believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only
Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have
doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that
these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the
right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be
several, including what would classically be called monophysite or
Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs
that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't
use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply
because it is not Biblical.  --clh]

 There was an article on clari.news.religion in the last few days about a
Polish tribunal decision. It said that crucifixes and religious classes in
public schools were okay; and that children who did not want to take religion
class could not be forced to take an ethics class as a substitute.

Herein lies the key to this thread:

Kindly note the difference in the responses.  Ed (and I) are talking
about knowing riding technique, while Mike is arguing knowing the physics
behind it.  It *is* possible to be taught the technique of countersteering
(ie: push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way) *without*
having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones
and such as seen in the parallel thread.  That stuff is mainly of interest
to techno-motorcycle geeks like the readers of rec.motorcycles  ;^),
but doesn't need to be taught to the average student learning c-steering.
Mike doesn't seem to be able to make the distinction.  I know people
who can carve circles around me who couldn't tell you who Newton was.
On the other hand, I know very intelligent, well-educated people who
think that you steer a motorcycle by either: 1) leaning, 2) steering
a la bicycles, or 3) a combination of 1 and 2.  Knowledge of physics
doesn't get you squat - knowledge of technique does!

You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in

No need to appologise, as a matter of fact
this reminds me to bring up something I

Most of the time, they do NOT like having
me and my bike anywhere near them, and will

An instructor once said it was because the

A while ago I installed SPSS for Windows as part of an evaluation. Once
the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC.

Unfortunately there is still a ""ghost"" of SPSS left: when I run
something like ""Write"" and go to embed an object then ""SPSS Chart""
appears on the list of objects I'm offered. I looked around all
the obvious ""INI"" files without success. The next thing I tried
was looking for the string ""SPSS Chart"" in every file in the 
Windows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or
REG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel
inclined to edit it.

I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers.

Their phone number is 1-800-377-9777. The last catalog shows three 
Oaks jerseys: 36 Home, 42 Home, 39 Home - they're each $165.00.  All their
merchandise is handmade and is an authentic replica.  I own a couple -
and they are excellent. They also have wool caps and jackets.  You should
call to get on their mailing list even if you can't afford their prices.

 Ah, now here is the core question. Let me suggest a scenario.

 We will grant that a God exists, and uses revelation to communicate
with humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your
own words) 'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck,
makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years'.)
 Now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a
revelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seem
to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the
observed world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are
many mutually contradictory claims of revelation.

 Now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent
a personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly
nothing to this 'revelation' thing?

 Absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the
claims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?

 Here is what I am driving at: I have thought a long time about this. I
have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is
nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.
 Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be held
accountable for such an honest mistake?

 Sincerely,

The final stages of denial... I can hardly imagine what the result
would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported
this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so
obviously doing.  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton
administration either, but the Clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition.

Both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem
to feel that they're doing you a favor.  If this is really surprising
to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
previous evidence.  There's only one political party (not calling
anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals
worthy in and of themselves.  If you're voting for the big two, you're
supporting a reduction of those rights (given their goals and their
histories), regardless of whether you personally support that
reduction.  To paint Clinton and Gore as unwitting tools is really
stretching things.

	Well, as compared to the normal Taurus, the SHO comes
with more supportive seats,better brakes,a stiffer suspension,
different tires, and a body design that takes advantage of aero
effects to keep the car on the ground (or at least I think that's
what all that boy-racer plastic is for).  You're kidding yourself if
you think any car on the road has a passenger compartment made to
withstand 130 MPH impacts.

They drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe, pal, and I reckon
a Taurus is at least as capable as a Rabbit.

That's fine, but would you name the ""industy experts"" so I can try to track

Yup.  That's why I'm kinda curious... most SCSI problems I've encountered
are due to cabling.

Well, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who ""hasn't 
matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old 
who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and 
have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim 
Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies 
hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has 
gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. 
I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.

>2.  Who is playing short and third?

Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but 
was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is 
split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry 
Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 
years.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be 
happy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they 
might give too much time to Pags.

I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in
Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
""months of investigation"" for their raid. 

I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused
of stockpiling a bunch of ""9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15
and M16 assault rifles"". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had
aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't
heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)

Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died!

X    10th International Obfuscated C Contest   
X    
X	""The original obfuscated contest""
X
X    Obfuscate:  tr.v.  -cated, -cating, -cates.  1. a.  To render obscure.
X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated 
X		their judgment.  [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) +
X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.
X                obfuscatory adj.
X 
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X 
X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X 
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since
X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works
X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.
X    (see ""The New Hacker's Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond)
X 
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical 
X    closing date for contests are in early May.
X 
X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c,
X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.  If you do not have access 
X    to these groups, or if you missed the early March posting, you may 
X    request a copy from the judges, via Email, at;

X    * To spread knowledge of PostScript and its details.
X    * To applaud those with the best tricks.

X
X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as
X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually
X    in the obfuscated directory. The judges will post the 1994 rules
X    in November to comp.lang.postscript on Usenet, and other places.
X    Send questions to jgm@cs.brown.edu.
X
X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork,
X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and
X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award.
X
X    The judges will choose the winners of each category.
X
X    Alena Lacova  is a system  administrator at NIKHEF  (Institute for High

I don't like this comment about ""Typical"" thinking. You could state
your interpretation of Exodus without it. As I read Exodus I can see 
a lot of killing there, which is painted by the author of the bible
in ideological/religious colors. The history in the desert can be seen
as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land. That's why I think
it is a great book with which descendants Arabs, Turks and Mongols can 
unify as well.

It's very possible, even likely, that the serial number of the
invididual chip is broadcast either in a standard encrypted 
format, so that all the big brother types need to do is listen to
the traffic, get  a court order (generally just by saying that they
think you may be a crook) and go to it.

The donations are tax deductible like any donations to a non-profit
organization.  I've donated money to a group restoring streetcars
and it was tax deductible.  Why don't you contribute to a group
helping the homeless if you so concerned?

I have a pair of Oakleys that cost about $100 new a year ago.  I hardly ever
wore them because they just don't look right on me.  They are orange and
blue and are the ""blade"" kind (Terminator style).  I am willing to sell these
for $40 to the first response I get. 
I also have a Bulls vs. Blazers game for the SNES that is in perfect

Well, I looked for it and didn't manage to find it in my listings for TNN.  Has  
anybody taped it VHS, and could they be persuaded to lend it to me after they

 My apologies!  I goofed.  The ""quick discharge"" option is part of the
Connectix PowerBook Utilities package (CPU).  I installed it the same
day as PowerStrip, and didn't pay enough attention.  ;)  Anyway, the
option does exist for those of you who buy CPU.

First of all, I'm not your buddy!  Second, read what I wrote.  I'm not
talking about what muslims are ALLOWED to do, merely what *SOME*
practice.  They consider themselves as muslim as you, so don't retort
with the old and tired ""they MUST NOT BE TRUE MUSLIMS"" bullshit.  If I
gave you the names what will you do with this information?  Is a fatwa
going to be leashed out against the perpetrators?  Do you honestly think
that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess? 
With the kind of extremism shown by your co-religionaries?  Fat chance.

At any rate, there can be no conclusive ""proof"" by the very nature of
the act.  Perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you in
theory, but hope that Allah will forgive them in the end.

I think it's rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslims
in this regard.  Also, kind of silly.  Are you insinuating that because
the Koranic law forbids it, there are no criminals in muslim countries? 

This is as far as I care to go on this subject.  The weakness of your
arguments are for all netters to see.  Over and out...

                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS
	     
                           Canada Place
                   Vancouver, British Columbia



2:46 P.M. PDT

	     	  
	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you 
could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll 
give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the 
Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government 
money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the 
government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going 
to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian 
businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What 
are the priorities, because there are several association of 
Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to 
participate in setting up priorities for investment?  
	     
	     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know 
that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans 
are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls 
say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times 
published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 
42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent 
if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to 
sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not 
very enthusiastic?  Thank you.
	     
	     Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going 
to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the 
answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, 
it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, 
the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will 
obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be 
good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will 
be used to support the privatization of existing public 
enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the 
Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have 
some influence over the distribution of.  
	     
	     With regard to your second question, let me say that 
I would think that there would be people in both countries who 
would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government 
giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to 
that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history 
there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That 
is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole 
history of America, any kind of aid program has always been 
unpopular.  
	     
	     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is 
this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that 
this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --
trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments 
because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in 
Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them 
working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies 
going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it 
possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the 
economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and 
investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce 
nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on 
our side and on the Russian side.  
	     
	     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an 
investment for the United States.  This is very much in the 
interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the 
second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next 
week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for 
the taxpayers and workers of my country.  
	     
	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some 
partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share 
her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view 
this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not 
what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful 
investment.  
	     
	     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But 
there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than 
the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier 
of the Cold War.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very 
much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory 
of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American 
President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind 
of a very measured breakthrough.  
	     
	     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory 
remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief 
that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you 
tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to 
what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification 
of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how 
confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager 
to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions 
inherited from the Cold War?  
	     
	     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of 
Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with 
regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent 
states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States 
develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing 
that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of 
the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude 
our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that 
would provide not only an important economic opportunity for 
Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out 
on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed 
off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and 
we agreed to continue to press that.
	     
	     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to 
reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the 
Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the 
United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, 
but that, in order to do what we need to do together to 
strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States 
be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join 
the NPT regime is critical.
	     
	     What was the second question?  
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and 
COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the 
Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, 
as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other 
restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on 
relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies 
of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of 
them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the 
leadership of the Congress.
	     
	     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be 
an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there 
are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to 
emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there 
is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed 
to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be 
much less.
	     
	     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing 
more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my 
own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement 
out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to 
begin it in the fairly near future.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in 
Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely 
different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not 
political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of 
Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the 
difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the 
difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of 
Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the 
last part of your speech?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to 
compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say 
what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a 
boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the 
music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been 
thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music 
for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists 
and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know 
as much as I could about your history.  
	     
	     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then 
the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last 
presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone 
in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. 
Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I 
was following events there very closely and hoping for the day 
when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a 
personal feeling about Russia.  
	     
	     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like 
music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a 
musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York 
Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony 
to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly 
than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically 
so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it 
occurred.  
	     
	     These are things that have always had a big impact 
on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever 
had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two 
countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

                               END3:06 P.M. PDT

Sorry, but I think this interpretation of the Matthew 13 parables is
nonsense. I.e.,

> 'yeast' - *ALWAYS* stands for sin/corruption/heresy. For example 'beware

Matthew 16:12 explains that by ""leaven of the Pharisees"" Jesus was simply
referring to their teaching; not sin/corruption/heresy.

Jesus gaves His apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that
the gates of hell would not prevail against His church.

Well, it wasn't that way for Enoch and Elijah, both of whom were
translated directly into heaven.  It's beyond my grasp why some object
that Mary, who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah, should not
benefit from the same privelege they recieved.  She was after all,
Mother of God, full of grace, and immaculate.

>Historically, belief in the Assumption can be found in the writings of

And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus, and in
St. Andrew of Crete, among others.

And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria
also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation, even though they
broke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the
Council of Chalcedon.  It might be argued by some Protestants that the
Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up, but the Monophysites, put a
big hole in that notion, as they also hold the belief, and they split
from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing (as
far as is known, much has been lost from the time of the Fathers).

Yep. Both were started (nominally) simultaneously. Splitsville from the

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I
ask this again:

1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be
   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?

2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies
   hole currents over normal electron currents?

3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of
   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual
   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,
   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,
   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,
   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).

NOTES:

   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area
   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole
   particles only exist in the presence of matter.
   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain
   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if
   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point
   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).
   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether
   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for
   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such
   currents *if* they exist.
   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics
   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by 
performing studies that are ""blind"" in various ways.  Some of these
are:

  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a 
     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the
     control group or the test group.

  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to 
differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis
is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on
which it is based so that others can verify it.  

It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because
those who performed the study did not ""blind"" themselves.  It is not
considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,
the control and test groups are treated alike.

Maybe cyclical is not the best word.  That is one aspect of it.  In the
case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and
also prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would 
cease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of 
Christ.

Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the
time they were made.  ""Out of Egypt have I called my Son"" refers both
to Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   ""Why do the heathen rage""
was said of David and also of Christ.  

Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, ""and his bishoprick
let another take.""  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His
disciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews, ""the children thou
hast given me.""

How does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.

I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus
confused ""kleros"", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of
land discussed.  In actuality it is ""chorion"", which is the last word Acts
1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss ""chorion"" so I
cannot report as to the nuances of the word.

Good point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you

At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a

around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe
it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:
Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use
several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.
It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.

The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the

(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;
(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look
at your defense of this later.
 
Also, the ""reward of iniquity"" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of
silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at
stating why you believe it is).
 
At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural
groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.

_____________________________________________________________________
 
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING
HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND ""FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN""
=============================================================
 
This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are
constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent
discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.
Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is
destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at
all.
Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and
was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do
they necessarily contradict each other?
Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that
Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling
something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be
true and supplementary.
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are
not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
was the decomposition of his body before his fall.
Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.
This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a
pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at
the same time.
On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting
himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping
form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the
case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a
situation of different perspectives of the same event.

Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer
it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out
that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a
bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy
movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.""
 
MY REPLY...
I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a
call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother
is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a
local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.
 
To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is
""begging the question"", if I may quote you.

Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention

Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we
have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's
synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But
he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can

So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's

Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or
deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done
with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including
their ""interpretation"" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find
some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.
 
You also noted they ""interpreted"" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although
that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,
that's the first criteria we must examine.

MY REPLY...
[^^^ above, mine]
No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly
probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.
 
The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New
Testament.
 
In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),
it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was
not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his
city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he
was buried in his father's tomb.""             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel ""hanged himself"" [Gr. Sept.,
APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, ""and died"".  Here we have no doubt of the
result.
In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.
 
Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply
means ""hang oneself"".

As I said in an earlier post...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable
explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),
I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.
 
MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and
said, ""It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the
price of blood."" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's
field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of
Blood to this day.
 
First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of
hanging. All it says is that he ""went and hanged himself."" Luke however, in
Acts, tells us that ""and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all
his entrails gushed out."" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the
other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,
etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear

Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.
Let's look at the passage in Matthew:
 
MAT 27:4 saying, ""I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" And they said,
""What is that to us? You see to it!""
 
MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself.
 
MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, ""It is not
lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.""
 
MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,
to bury strangers in.
 
MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
 
Notice verse 5...""Then he...went and hanged himself.""
Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a

death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
say Judas ""hanged himself"", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the
hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no
contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.

MY REPLY...
...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records
his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be
the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________________________________________________________________
 
I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but
in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,
highly probable.                            ^^^^^^

""By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had
different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One
simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as
the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  ""The Biblical Knowledge Commentary""
suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly
exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope
broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain
how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).""
 
MY REPLY...
The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person
was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may
have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell
upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a
superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not
given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted
post gave us some...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open.
_____________________________________________________________________

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the
source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is
correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist
who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to
thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the
prophesy of the Potter's field came from).""
 
MY REPLY...
Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
this with you.
 
DB...
As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather
than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically
mention ""the reward of iniquity"" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions
what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 ""...concerning
Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus."").  Now I would point out
that when the Bible describes an act of ""iniquity,"" and then immediately
discusses ""*the* reward of iniquity,"" it would be rather inane to suggest that
it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.""
 
MY REPLY...
Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!
 
ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,
ACT 1:16 ""Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy
Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide
to those who arrested Jesus;
ACT 1:17 ""for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.""
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field
is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)
ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Notice that in verse 16, the word ""iniquity"" is not used.  Rather, it states
that Judas ""became a guide to those who arrested Jesus"".
But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and
obtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry?
         ^^^^^^
JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a
thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.
JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had
said to him, ""Buy those things we need for the feast,"" or that he should give
something to the poor.
 
So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.
Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,
according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of ""wages of
iniquity"" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen
by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical
explanation of what the ""wages of iniquity"" are.  What do you think, Dave?

First, let me offer you my condolences.  I've had kidney stones 4 times 
and I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see 
a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the
only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a
urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones
are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it
out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she
absolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps
an over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.
Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed 
to make sure there is not a serious problem.

I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret,
and some things that i think it implies. (Of course these could all be
wrong.....) 

from 

                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY
                               Dorothy Denning
                           Revised, April 21, 1993

.
.
.

The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called ""Skipjack.""  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

.
.
.

ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.

Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

------------------

suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but
did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from
if law enforcement field 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F]
not knowing N would might make this much harder.

Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),
If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U
for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the
other party.

If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could
make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also
allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are
saying but I could know who you are saying it too.

Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of
messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key
generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that
matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be
chosen from know weak keys for the system.

Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement
for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that
it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of
people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some ""panel of experts"" is
going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget
grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.

So, am I wrong? Or are these problems.

Now why would anyone ""post"" anything encrypted? Encryption is only of

While shopping for a passenger helmet, I noticed that in many cases the
external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL.  The
difference was the amount of inside padding.

My solution was to buy a large helmet, and construct a removable liner 
from a sheet of .5"" closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside
surface).  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion
with the liner in, and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with
the liner out.  Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit.

You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter!
So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to
a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.

As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most
notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets,
rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup
in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.

GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them
regularly (using the test button).

Running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I
have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check
their common sense list.  Please exercise caution.

I bought this chip from Suncoast Technology and tried to build their

If anyone has the pinouts and possibly the voltage specs I'd sure
appreciated it.  If someone could fax, email, or snail mail a copy

Please email me if you can help.

Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy-
theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist 
support?  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People 
are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the
eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People
begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children
and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.

Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale
of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his 
conclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these
idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.

Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating
skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.

I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated 
political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the ""right"" things
(where ""right"" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement)
is showing an acute case of ""myopic social perspective"", not to mention
arrogance and utter stupidity.

Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established
body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of
virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination
of local control over Affairs Public.  

Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated 
like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic 
people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the ""oughta-be's""
inside their own hopelessly closed minds.

OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific

Hmmm, ""Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion,
nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""  Liberal translation: ""the
federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local
school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays,
while prohibiting others.""

I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing
for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.

Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.

Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you
may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it
primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences
of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of
conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk
resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their
good fortune?

This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America
that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People

I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary
piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain ""venom""
at all, let alone ""venom"" comparable to an individual who callously murdered
millions out of racism.



>On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society

A very serious tone in that oratory.

You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, 
BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather
than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention 
that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.
He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be
intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).
This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is
treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.

I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just
kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and
needed to be exterminated.



>On Religion as the Basis of a Nation
>        Hitler: ""In this world human culture and civilization are

>sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the 
>expulsion from Paradise."" (Page 581.)

This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since
Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of
the Aryan as ""the highest image of the Lord"" fits with Christian doctrine.



>        Limbaugh: ""America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... 
>But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or 
>ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a 
>charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools 
>for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of 
>American education has declined ever since?"" (pages 274-5.)

Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than
publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-
Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent
to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching
just a wee bit here.



>On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse
>        Hitler: ""The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... 
>One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and 
>theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... 
>Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays 
>must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the 
>service of a moral idea of State and culture."" (pages 346 and 348.)

Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment
industry here.


>        Limbaugh: ""Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that 
>Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people 
>who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality 
>and monagamy. They disparage American heroes."" (page 254.)

Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate
government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show
to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the
depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control 
of Hollywood.

90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control 
of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an
early age the ""right"" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. 
Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the ""young heads full
of mush"" hyperbole indicates.



>On the News Meida
>        Hitler: ""The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of 
>gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass 
>by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the 
>people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of 
>slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews."" (Page 331.)

Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for
government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.

>and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania."" (pages 270 and 268.)

Indication here that ""Elements of the Media"" (since career is a self-selected
categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in
the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.
No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only
that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the
situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.

You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable 
opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his 
audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that 
purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree 
or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who 
is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?

Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would
oppose government control of the media.

It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.
Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people
who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology
on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?
Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that
they exist in your mind, not the real world.

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve
Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading
laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.

As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.
Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend
of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism
in America through ""business/government partnership"" and increased levels
of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes
in grade school.

Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler
because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of
racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to
racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear 
racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal 
Left.

The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked
on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized
Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to 
that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear
to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush 
Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than 
the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

Do you mean that the Pentium is better than a Risc?  or that it will outsell
them all?  If the first, you have to remember that intel CISC (like the
pentium) are a always a generation away from the best riscs... also Riscs
cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities (not

Thank you very much. After reading the text some distinct questions

would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?

First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how
does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically
in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the
phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,
or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)

Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not
a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-
security.

So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these

Wow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret,

It seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time,

My 1988 Toyota 4Runner has a rolldown rear window with a keylock
switch.  It sticky on me.  Yesterday it was tough to get the
key to work and it also happened to stick on in the up direction
so the stalled motor was powered all night killing the battery.

I'd like to try to lubricate the lock switch. What should I lubricate
the lock with?

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste*
on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, 
but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,
scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a ""we have 
the money, why not?"" approach.

It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you
put a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year? Even if you
use grad students?

Let me see if I have this straight --- if a person knows S1 and S2,
and the serial number of the unit, it's easy to reconstruct UK.
Of course, if they know SK, the ""family key"", they can easily get the
serial number of any unit that has made a transmission.  So with S1 and
S2 being used for a while ""batch"" of the unit keys, the number of
used S1/S2 pairs will probably be fairly low.  Of course, you have to
believe that the NSA/FBI/name-your-favorite-government agency will
know SK so all it needs is the S1/S2 pairs, and presto, nasty details 
like court orders for wire taps are no longer necessary.

Now, I'm not one of the people who distrusts the government at every

around is pushing what I'm willing to believe just a little bit too far.

See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez
to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward
to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember
being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was
only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first?
Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was
there.  Sure, I say go for it.

I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas
was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/
Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.

BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.





>Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game,
let's compare our decision to one of the most ""Boneshead"", right?

Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a
longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't
make the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior
history, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a 
career as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  -
laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess
Mieske has a future.)

(I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)

I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous.  In any
case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against
the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that
was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their
standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to
things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and
license information, photographs, etc.

> 2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ?

You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess
is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in
political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as
agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.
At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to
Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt
to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters
will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law
entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my
previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation
even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further
dissemination of certain types of private information about them.

But the ancient Romans did not observe a seven-day week.  Unless a
man was working for a Jewish employer, he is unlikely to have been
paid on the first day of a seven-day week. Nor would a Jewish
employer have kept his wages over the week-end (see Lev 19:13; Dt

It depends on how badly you want to live.  The FAA says ""eight hours, bottle

a blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, I think, which is more than
twice as strict as DWI minimums.

Keywords: youths drugs LSD inhalants
Lines: 62


The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14,
1993 issue of USA Today (""Drug Use Up At Younger Age"" by Mike
Snider, p. 1A).

    Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -
    usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue
    and air fresheners, says a new survey.

    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds
    ""statistically significant increases"" in eighth-graders' use of
    many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.

    ""We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing
    drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters
    adolescence,"" says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief
    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and
    Human Services.

    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long
    decline.

    The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the
    following in the 30 days before they were polled:

        * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;
                         cocaine 1.3%.

    Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants
    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.

    * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%
    over 1991. 

    * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%
    tried it in the last year.

    Reducing drug use among students ""requires a different kind of
    strategy"" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part
    of an overall illness prevention plan.

    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders
    disapprove of them.

    ""It's scary,"" Shalala says.  ""Dealers are focusing on younger, more
    vulnerable kids.""

My Honda Accord just hit the magic 100,000 mile mark and now

car fine, but once I am stopped completely, my brake pedal
will sink another 2 or 3 inches all by itself.  If feels really
strange, and I am worried my brakes will quit working one of
these days.

I checked my brake fluid, and the reservoir was full, but the
fluid itself looked really dirty (like dirty oil).  I called
my mechanic and he told me I need a new brake master cylinder,
which will cost me a whopping $250-300.

I was just wondering if anyone out there has experienced this
sort of thing.  If so, is my mechanic being honest? Or do I
simply need to have my brakes bled and new fluid put in?

Any help you could provide would be appreciated.  Please send

Actually, the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as 
God commanded him to.  Lucifer was devoted to God.

Oh yeah, there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anything
more than a snake (well, a talking one...had legs at the time, too).

I don't think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best way
to show the error in theology:  if they think a supernatural entity
kicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a
fruit that gave them special powers...well, they might not respond
well to reason and logic.  :^)

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity.
Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about
anti-trust in the business world.

Since we are debating the legality of a commercial
transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines
and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says
that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of
investing, you can not acquire a large number of those
shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so
only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,
the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some
designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.
They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.

The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the
old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /
multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours
was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair
market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of
an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist
myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).

Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get
on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its
OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is
a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it
has an integer square root.

Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that
every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in
Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an
escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with
you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,
just being rethorical.

Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic
within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).
Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic
cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the
international community, or make the best out of a no win
condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the
'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the
arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So
yes, they're there. But as a community with history and
roots, its dead.

I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not
predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no
problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were
predominantly Jewish. So there. what to make of the rest
Palestine?

Bricklins were manufactured in the 70s with engines from Ford. They are rather  
odd looking with the encased front bumper. There aren't a lot of them around,  
but Hemmings (Motor News) ususally has ten or so listed. Basically, they are a  
performance Ford with new styling slapped on top.

Well, this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over
into alt.atheism, where we spend most of our time entertaining
arguments against our belief system, without resorting to accusing
others of bigotry.  It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry
happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I
always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I
understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who
happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or
other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen
indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are
exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further
evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people
are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are
discriminatory.

Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0
and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to
appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would
be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.

No Integra I have seen comes with all-season tires. 
The GTZ does come with much bigger 16"" wheels.

The C+D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype

16.1 sounds reasonable, probably faster than regular Integras.

The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed
box more than any other modern car. Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra
equals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.

The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon. It
was a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.

The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k
miles, a rare screw up by Honda.
Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take
the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR.

how so? i think you're making assumptions here that might not

revolvers are just as effective, if not more so.

wait, doesn't Chicago have -serious- gun control? if so, why do the

all the patrol cars i've seen around here have shotguns clamped to 
the dash board. IMHO, that's all the police need to outgun just about 
anything.

Hi, everyone;


I need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster.

Several weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external HD for mac. The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend and
they agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in
English) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the check
arrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is
that. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not
bounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student at
University of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal address
and his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Sincerely,
Victor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)

P.S. The reason I did not put R.E.P.'s full name is that I still hope...


P.P.S. If I get enough responses I will post a summary, maybe even on a
regular basis.

I recall reading/seeing that former baseball star Chris Chambliss' hitting

right-eye dominance.

The best group to keep you informed is the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation
of America.  I do not know if the UK has a similar organization.  The
address of
the CCFA is 

CCFA
444 Park Avenue South
11th Floor
New York, NY  10016-7374
USA

They have a lot of information available and have a number of newsletters.
 
Good Luck.

Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to 
purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be
one of the following:
a) An employee of a government agency.
b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.
c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in
research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: 
The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.
Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction
and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.

The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any 
organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions 
to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:
- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the
location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. 
- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft
within the operating radius around the launch site.
- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.
- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that
unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.

Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)
are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the
western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular
since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).

The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'
use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is
from 50 to 500 or more feet. 

By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from
most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart
C, for details.

As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to
50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical
rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,
or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry
either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches
in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.

Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.

>And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.

Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets
for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything
bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to
practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs
takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.

>-Paul ""mine'll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite"" Dokas

That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE
ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest
misconceptions people have about our hobby. 

>/*            Just remember, you *WILL* die someday.             */
True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get 
hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand.

The cads! The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of
course is not mentioned. It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms
to Iran, it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq.

Still this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing.

In the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided
that Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with
damascus during the gulf war. One day the US is certain that its Syria,
the next Lybia. For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to
Lybian courts for extradition proceedings. Faced with similar demands the
USA would reject them as would any other country.

The word is ""terrorism"".


The problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an
image abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests
then comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a
fitting combination of the words ""freedom"" ""dignity"" ""democaracy"" or
of ""terrorism"" ""dictatorship"" etc as appropriate.

The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran. The people there are
rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they
loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack. 
Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be
the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be
movement it would be easier for the USA to move.

First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the
Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil
production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment 
Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would
use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.

The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment 
simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating. They also need
western technology.

What does this have to do with my original question???  I previously
stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen
just to make sure that my image had data, and it did.  This is NOT
a problem with expose events, it has to do with XCopyPlane not
working!!!

Does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
XCopyPlane works???  This would be very helpful!

Thanks to all who responded to my original post.  I got the number for
Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the
BIOS to the Super BIOS.  It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/
write heads and up to 1024 cylinders.  The upgrade is $15, payable by
check or money order.  Send to:

	Western Digital Corporation
	Technical Support Group
	P.O. Box 19665
	Irvine, CA  92713-9665

The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the
WD1002 series.

The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives.

The responses to my request for help follow my .sig.  Warning: It's long.

     Ah, finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this older
stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)

     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be
compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  

    Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on
the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read 
either :     62-000042-015 or
             62-000094-0x2

     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.

    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between
pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.

>The drive jumpers are as follows: (""8"" represents jumper)

    Looks right.
  
[art deleted]

>Here are my questions:
>
>1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?

      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are
what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have
the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:

              5 + +    open
              6 + +    open             
              7 + +    open        
              8 + +    open
              4 + +    closed
              3 + +    closed
              2 + +    open
              1 + +    open

    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.
Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8
select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the
second drive (drive 1).   

      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have
to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.

>2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?

      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not
right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables
are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it
to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   
     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few
times and banged my head for a day.....

>3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?

     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way
to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:
       
        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)
   
    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.

>Keith Rice

      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's
just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).

          NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS 
          contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.  
          When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will 
          not ""boot.""  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips 
          must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital  
          XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 
          or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT 
          controller you are using).

          NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, 
          WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in 
          Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or 
          ""A"" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) 
          instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or 
          the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the 
          etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then 
          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the 
          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 
          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION 
          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY 
          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the 
          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must 
          be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the 
          interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

     HARD DISK CONTROLLERS FOR SCSI HARD DISK DRIVES
     
          
          7000-ASC - A SCSI host adapter that serves as an interface 
          between the AT bus and the SCSI bus.  All necessary drivers and 
          receivers are included, permitting direct cable connections to 
          the SCSI bus through a 50 pin connector and to the AT bus 
          through two edge connectors.  The 7000-ASC utilizes jumper  
          configurable options that enable the address space, DMA channels 
          and interrupt requests to be selected to suit the end user's 
          application.  The board also features word data transfer at 4 
          megabytes per second (synchronous), an on-board floppy disk 
          controller and a ROM BIOS.  Please note that the 7000-ASC 
          operates using standard DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3 only.
          
          7000-FASST2 - This SCSI host adapter card provides the same 
          features as the 7000-ASC plus additional support capabilities 
          using software developed by Columbia Data Products.  The 7000-
          FASST2 will support MS-DOS 3.2-3.3, Compaq DOS 3.31, PC-DOS 4.0, 
          PC-MOS/386 version 2.1, XENIX, Microsoft Windows, Novell and 
          Sytos tape backup.
          
          WDATXT-FASST KIT - An ""unintelligent"" SCSI host adapter that is 
          compatible with the IBM XT, AT and compatible systems.  It uses 
          a 50 pin external SCSI bus ""D"" connector with a standard 50 pin 
          internal SCSI cable.  The WDATXT-FASST can be used as  both a 
          target and an initiator and it serves as an excellent tool for 
          SCSI designers.  It also provides a low cost alternative for end-
          users desiring to install a SCSI peripheral device such as a 
          hard disk drive or a tape backup unit. The kit includes an 8-bit 
          SCSI HBA board, manual, FASST software diskettes and an internal 
          SCSI cable.
          
          SYTOS TAPE BACKUP - (Utility for 7000-FASST) - FASST-SYTOS -

   Taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with
   much else that has been published here about brute force DES
   cracking, unless Russell was lucky with respect to the key), I'd be
   very interested in whether the program Russell used is available?

key search is very practical in many real situations since people use
such stupid keys on the average.  password crackers know this well.

   Depending on his answer, this could be an appalling development
   calling into question both DES and RSA/DES.

not really.  in fact, public key based communication systems very
often pick keys automatically which are much better than passwords or
pass phrases.

   If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack
   a single DES message in a couple of days (assuming no tricks that
   are message-specific),

if a person picked the password or pass phrase, then the key search is
pretty straightforward.  in running english text, the average content
of a single word is about 8 bits.  in pass phrases, this may increase
to 10 bits or so.  searching 30bit spaces is semi-practical even in
software and searching 40bit spaces isn't outrageous to imagine with
hardware assists of moderate size.

Well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to 
social and political instability, while economic inequality is much more
strongly related.  In virtually all major revolutions including
England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the 
revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term 
growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive
inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom
that social change is possible.

If ""poverty (were) the main engine of social instability,"" this typical
historical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been
far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.

Sorry, buddy, but some other ""blowhards"" managed to include the ""general
welfare"" in another portion of the constitution.

Article I Section 8: ""The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect
taxes...to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL
WELFARE of the United States...""

I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
said in the preamble.

But as noted above, the constitution doesn't say that, does it?

But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
in Article I, Section 8, I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional
functions.  Right?

I would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in
daylight.  The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward
30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give
information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s),
possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp
current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

Has anyone done something like this?

This was known as *Journey to the Far Side of the Sun* in the United
States and as *Doppelganger* in the U.K.  It was produced by the great
team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (whose science was usually a bit
better than this).  It may have been their first production using live
actors-- they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows,
such as *Supercar*, *Stingray*, and *Thunderbirds*.  Later, they went
on to do more live-action SF series: *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.

The astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, VTOL
airliners, and mighty Portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to
look at.

... Wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold? My gut feeling is that, as a

It is silly to make this statement.  Fifteen minutes after the fire
started, the ""official word"" out of FBI  headquaters in DC was
that the DV's committed suicide.  It would seem logical that the
lantern story has more credibility.  You can't even to pretend to
know for sure what happened... although Clinton is doing just that.

I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of
the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone
decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper
algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly
difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able
to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a
description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out 
the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an
uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think
about design decisions made by other designers.

I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using
""tamperproof"" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive
and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that
there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication
of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these
supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely
reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot
bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that
""well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret,
isn't it?""

Just some random thoughts...

I haven't been following this, so I'm sorry if somebody already mentioned  
this, but you could grab a lemon (I think potatoes work too, but I'm not  
sure), a strip of copper, and a strip of zinc (I think you can get the  
metal in a hardware store or hobby shop, maybe??).  Stick the strips in  
the lemon (so they don't touch!) and you'll get a measurable voltage (not  
a lot, but, hey, it's a lemon :-)  ).  As I recall we had to hook  
something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of  
current, because of the mondo internal resistance, but if you just need a  
demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something! :-)

From Israeline 4/14

Today's MA'ARIV reports that yesterday, following Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's meeting with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat and
prominent Palestinian Faisal al-Husseini, the latter said that in
principle, the Palestinians have decided to participate in the
peace talks. Nonetheless, he noted that everything will be decided
upon at the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Damascus. The
newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently
made to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian
delegation to the peace talks. The threats, in Arabic, demanded
that the delegates not go to Washington to, ""sell out the
Palestinian people."" One caller threatened, ""Should you go, you
will not find your family alive upon your return."" The newspaper
states that such phone calls were received, as far as is known, at
the houses of Faisal al-Husseini, Hanan Ashrawi and others.

suite of standard UNIX utilities.  There are other similar systems from
other vendors as well.  The EMX system for OS/2 gives you most of the
standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under
OS/2.  Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs
directly in either case, but EMX makes OS/2 almost as compatible with
UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other.  And, best of
all, EMX is free.  :-)

There is a similar system (GO32) for DOS, but it doesn't work with
Windows, as far as I know.

Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows, neither of
which is a standalone OS at this point.  Neither OS/2 nor UNIX requires
DOS.

BTW, two of the best unices I've seen for the pee cee are UNIXWare ($300
for the personal edition) and LINUX (free).  So I don't agree that ""a
good one costs $400-$700.""  :-)

And, if you really want to check out the various options available to
you, you should also look into DESQview and DESQview/X.

Time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses, cameras and photo stuff
that's not being used.  Some are gems, some are mundane.
 
 
Minolta AF 50/1.7 lens for Maxxum cameras.  New lens, but I guess it'd
be best to call it a ""demo"" since I did not get the literature, box or
warranty cards.  $30.
 
Vivitar 2X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses.  Pretty cute ""flip back""
tang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses - and bodies.
It will even couple (and double) a non-AI lens to an AI body.  $15.
 
Pentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens.  Well actually it's a Super-Takumar which
is what they all were back then.  Very mint condition.  $25. Nice hard
case for this lens $5 more..
 
Alpex 135/2.8 lens.  Beautifully made, all metal construction with fine
optics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this with
strap can be added..call it $7 more.
 
Vivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285
eclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure.
$30.
 
Universal ""Roamer 63"" folding old ""bellows"" camera with leather case.
Uses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutter
release.  Decent shape.  $20.
 
Weston 540 lightmeter.  Nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is a
good cross check to built in meters.  $7 with case and strap.
 
And finally..the ""gems""
 
Pentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F2.8 lens.  This is the little
(and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses,
but try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with
split image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70.
 
Olympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mm
lens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  I
think this was the predecessor to the XA - and it's nearly all metal.
I won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell.  $60.
 
Olympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, and
Tokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice to
mint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the film
advance lever.  Lenses are perfect, and the Tokina is a very compact,
and sharp lens.  $225 for the set.
 
 
That'll do to clean out some of the stuff.  Feel free to offer on this
stuff, although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in
shipping it..
 
For more details call or email.

Ouch. :-)   This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
Hurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function
provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the 
CBR900RR and the GTS1000A.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sweden opened the scoring as Markus Naslund made a drop pass at the Finnish
 blue line, Popovic picked it up and advanced towards the Finnish goal and
 shot a nice hard wrist shot in Ketterer's top corner. Ville Siren's slap
 shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi
 scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal
 put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.
 The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo
 made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,
 during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.
 Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to
 Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered
 the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund 
 skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.
 Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line
 where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since
 there was traffic in front, 4-3.
 Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan ""the Shadow"" Nilsson. Stefan
 and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to
 Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.
 Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only
 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone 
 with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja
 made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.
 The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal
 late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,
 showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck
 and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.
 But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the
 game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow
 angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.

 All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.
 Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period
 to try no combinations.

 Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-
 Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.
 Stillman good on defense.
 Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner
 hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson
 will likely have to leave for NHL pros.

 Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the
 Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him
 a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.
 I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-
 resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.

Subject: How does it really work? (was Re: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption)
Organization: Computer Science Dept, Indiana University
Distribution: na
Lines: 57

This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything
evil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open
algorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start
panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but
I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts
explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and
long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to
subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the
administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and
RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much
wider than us computer geeks.

The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:

1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just
    now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.

2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able
    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I
    find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy
    for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the
    administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for
    all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made
    widely available.)

Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):
>This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
>information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
>and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
>electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
>ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to

The majority of the discussion involving this ""Clipper Chip"" seems to
pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone
know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.

The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements
symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?

I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it
is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level
encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate
a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted
third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session
key?)

If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover
all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting
royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the
algorithm secret? :-)

Subject: Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)
Organization: Adobe Systems Incorporated
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]
Lines: 79


I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor
is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17"" Magnavox went away.  It
isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the
monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.

In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors
in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program
which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,
Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those
are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses
a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite
card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as
I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to
print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3
cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.

The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if
you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high
refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz
at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution
was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,
and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.

The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone
with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable
to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have
the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.

The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules
Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they
were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz
386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers
were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with
8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.


K means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second

The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,
filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics
operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two
numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.
When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --
1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me....

I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what
I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,
but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my
work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the
knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.

They come with every Iris now.  Nth also ships it with their latest

    My guess is Jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low
    on base percentage.  Whiten was a great acquisition... decent offense
    and great defense in rightfield.  But don't worry, Gilkey will be
starting        
    as soon as Jordan or Whiten displays an extended period of low offensive

Thessaloniki is called Thessaloniki by its inhabitants for the last 2300 years.
The city was never called Solun by its inhabitants.
Instabul was called Konstantinoupolis from 320 AD until about the 1920s.
That's about 1600 years. There many people alive today who were born in a city
called Konstantinoupolis. How many people do you know that were born in a city

Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers, in
defiance to Virginia's law against radar detectors, passed out
thousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near
the Virginia State lines.  At that time there were no radar
detector Detectors!  I am not sure of the impact but I would
imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a
radar detector became difficult - if not impossible!

As I said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law
against radar detectors has been in vain.  In fact, effective
Jan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector
accessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.  

I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2
meter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detector
scream!  I am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the
brake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)

  The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting 
Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire;
he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't
all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when
everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy
Campanella.

  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play
him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter.
Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez
will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they
play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching
tandem.

  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher
defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from
your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is
opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.
Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. 

  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big
bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that
they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard
plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak 
defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of
Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich
Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. 
I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.

The war in 1982 was instigated by the Arabs who continually murdered

The Red Sox usually have 2 catchers.  I don't think they have a backup now,
but they used to use Randy Kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle
infielder and outfielder.  You don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a
competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick
a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field.

Well, I don't recall assuming anything, except perhaps that the columnist

Not necessarily the most misleading, but you are right, it definitely

There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just
a little over a decade ago, and noone showed up for the early rounds in
the playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up
arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds.  

The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will
show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the
Bruins play the Captials in the first round.

Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will
no longer be the case.  The experiment is worthwhile with the uneven
distribution of the expansion teams, but I prefer the divisional 
playoff.

didn't score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his

I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.  I had to get

To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and
blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.
Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur.
This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
devices can ""hiccup"" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle
of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager
will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't
pay attention to the errors coming back.

Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but
rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when
the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte
hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus
error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and 
exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The
facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians 
in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly
to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques
which were technically possible only recently.

The idea that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi citizens died is
ludicrous.  Not even ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi soldiers died,
and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US
and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?
Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),
or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to
destroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are
not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.
Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,
not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their
tyrant-dictator.

How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?
I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but
with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage
of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are
misidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.
But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth
like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is
worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, ""I know not what
course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me
death!""  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one
wishes to stay free.

Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.
You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I
feel sure that was not your intent.

So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have
worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we
shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent
German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor 
French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We 
should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking
German instead of English right now.

Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand
diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is
that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so
now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to
mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait 
was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!

And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*
the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of ""not guilty""?
Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those
policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.
But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I
have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a
trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply
lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind
which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends
to support in the case against the policemen.  

Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,
whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is
a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position
to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply
succumbing to verbal vigilantism.

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted 
and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because 
of race, religion and national origin?

As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and 
idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A 
short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda 
and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious 
for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their 
neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely 
within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to 
x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is 
the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary 
heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, 
even lunatic. 

And we still demand:

1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian 
dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;

2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;

3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their
heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;

4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide 
and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian 
political pressure.

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first 
genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. 

Now what would you do? 

Source: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by 
        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)

    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.

    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former
Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.
    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more
than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an
attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and
feared dead.
    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending
the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified
refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:"" That's when
the real  slaughter began,"" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to
survive. ""The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.""
    "" They were shooting, shooting, shooting"", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who
arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through
Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed
in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.
    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.

    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,
were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their
wounds or the cold.
    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in
Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the
seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were
women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.
    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they
had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds.
    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city
which  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and
killing one person.

11:45 A.M. EDT
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's 
protest today?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.  
I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago, 
which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase 
minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we 
should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  
And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's 
a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an 
informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to 
the game.  So, I think it's good.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think they're moving fast enough?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first 
step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an 
issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to 
give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will 
highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate 
on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break 
that and get cloture?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I 
mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one 
of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you 
know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate 
the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not 
like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they 
can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a 
lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote 
for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political 
pressure not to do it.  
	     
	     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when 
no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an 
economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're 
willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston 
and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very 
sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in 
a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans 
had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the 
program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots 
level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they 
have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep 
Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz

Subject: Torture

Title of article: Moderate physical pressure

Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation
room in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,
beaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a
Shabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife.
""At those moments"", Omar said, ""I felt that he was like a
humanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat
me and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed
yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being"".

In late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm
prison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. ""Among the Jews,
as among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people"", he said
after his release, ""but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations
rooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that
he is a human being"". Although he left the detention installation
in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (""I sat at home for ten days. My
hands shook from nerves""), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He
got out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned
to normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.

In contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released
seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the
Shabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or
react. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early
August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left
it one day later - dead. ""We have recently received an especially
large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at
the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators"", noted
Dr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and
Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)

The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan
Saber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely
fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated
in Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would
return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.

(...follow description of tortures....)

Omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. ""I do not want to talk about
it"", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and
ashamed, he spoke: ""Sometimes he beats you and beats you until
you'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of
another interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,
and the last interrogator says:"" Now you are kissing my hand, and
later if I want, you will kiss my ass.""

These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,
located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West
Bank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In
early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the
Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to
visit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation
wing. ""The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely
under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by
it"", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the
installation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem
member, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er,
governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command,
was quoted in the report:  ""There is an ethical problem here - no
one can enter the interrogation wing"".

If anybody wanted proof of the nonsense of the ""you can't build guns"" claim,
they need look no farther than the Philippines.  Amateur gunsmiths there
regularly produce everything from .45 automatics to full auto shotguns.  Now
if this guy wants to claim that the Philippines is either technologically
superior to the US or that their transportation is better than ours, all I
can say is that he's living in a fantasy world.

I don't know which passage you are refering to, but the passage I have
often seen cited as an example of a mother image of God is Isaiah 49:15
""Can a woman forget her sucking child / that she should have no 
compassion / on the son of her womb? / Even these may forget, / 
yet I will not forget you."" 
 
This passage is *not* a mother image of God at all. The mother here
is the image of the best human constancy can show, and it is 
contrasted with the constancy of God. The mother figure here represents
mankind, not God.

The Chevrolet brothers were respected racers & test drivers for the
Buick Co. when Durant was there.

When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and
others with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful
Chevrolet company.

A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM!
That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company
Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!

After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM
board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given
the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure.
(If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy
division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the ""passenger
car division"" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)

According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal & a few

reason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics - a
rare example of governmental wisdom.  The limit has a five year
moratorium on it, and ""specialist"" manufacturers will be exempt anyway. 
Any suspicion that this is a crafty trick to restrict that end of the

Tell that to the Japanese, their local market is neatly protected by
the Japanese government. Its one very tough nut to crack. In fact
the only current way to break into it, is to do it with a Japanese

If you want to see environmental disasters, go to eastern Europe or some
parts of the FSU (former Soviet Union).  This is because they had no
environmental protection laws and were trying to increase productivity
at any expense to justify their political systems.  Luckily for us, some
of our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws.  That
isn't to say that they shouldn't be modified, but all I ever hear from
you is that the environmental laws were dreamed up by a bunch of
left-wing tree-huggers intent on putting us back on horseback.  Yes,
there are some of those, but a lot of us simply want to procede with
caution.

Which crap, the ridiculous assertions that Uzis are mowing down cops
right and left? The assertions that dialing 911 should be the proper
and only option available to the law-abiding citizens?

A factoid:

56 cops were killed in the whole country last year. This is down from
around 100 in the early '80s. Wow, a real explosion in cop killings
there eh?  :-)

Very simple.

""X-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
 against 2.5 million Muslims by admitting to the crime and making 
 reparations to the Turks and Kurds.""

After all, your criminal grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim
people between 1914 and 1920.

You must be a new 'Arromdian'. You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF 
crooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in 
such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has 
already been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer 
and hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible 
for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian 
and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government 
as merely a step on the road to said genocide.

 Here we go again..
 In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give 
 the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!
 (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of
 pages, please ask by sct) 
 
 
I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc.

 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198

>

 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
 not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993.

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,
women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and 
those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

Not a chance.

 the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun

Did they or did they not sustain Miller's conviction? I don't have the
text of the case handy. 

Yes, shotguns had been used in WWI, the Spanish-American War, and the
US Civil War. That was not in question. The possession of a sawed-off
shotgun was, i.e., a weapon altered to improve concealibility.

Here in Houston last year a woman heard the sound of someone in her
garage, so she went to investigate with a gun in her hand.  She
found a guy in the process of stealing her bicycle.  She quite
reasonably asked him to stop.  He refused, began taunting her, and
as the woman was quoted in the police report, ""He told me to go
ahead and shoot him, so I did.""  The moron survived, and no
charges were filed against the woman.

Subject: Radar detector DETECTORS?
Organization: Virginia's Public Education Network (Richmond)

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to:

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too!

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. 
Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!"" 
But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.

Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.

For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary.

So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?
  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna?

What kind of post is this?  If you have something substantial to tell the world,
then at least give us details!  So what if they are coming out with new Macs,
they always do that... what's new about these models?  Etc...

The average amerikan today seems to think that the government should be
able to eavesdrop on everyone (else).  Opinion polls show that most
people belive the Bill of Rights to grant too much freedom to people,
when it is not identified as such (BTW, if anyone knows of a cite for that,
I'd love to have it).  Not only does this mean that these people are 
willing to give up everyone (else's) rights, they don't even know what 
the Bill of Rights actually says.

How can we show the average person (not the average USENET reader) that
people are actually entitiled to these rights?  So many people don't
care if the government is taking more and more control of us all, a little 
at a time.  

If there was some sort of awareness of what the government is trying
to do by a majority of the US population... Just think about what
could be accomplished - but there are so many that trust, unthinkingly,
in whatever the media and government tell them.

A couple of other tips.

1) Make a habit of parking the bike so that instruments are facing away
   from the sun.

2) Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish & Plastic Cleaner. (Cue canned
   product plug #2543):

What you want are Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish and Plastic
Cleaner. They are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches from
plastic. For fine scratches just use the Polish, for bigger ones start
with the Cleaner and finish with the Polish. The stuff is $5-8 bucks per
bottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores. Don't choke over the
price too much, since both bottles will probably last you 10 years. The
stuff works great on plastic watch ""crystals"" and compact discs too.

In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed 
with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.

A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of 
that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than 
you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the 
printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the 
printer)

A sage said to me: ""Do you want one copy or lots of copies?"", ""One"", 
""Inkjet"".

Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter 
will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that 
are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.

HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the 
software package has no inkjet driver. 

There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a 
page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a 
laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers 
actually use this facility.
(there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)

We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the
International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also
some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of
groups.  Sorry for the cross posting.

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines.
(See the diff marks at the right hand edge)  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are
in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry 
about these changes.

X    10th International Obfuscated C Contest
X
X	""The original obfuscated contest""
X
X    Obfuscate:  tr.v.  -cated, -cating, -cates.  1. a.  To render obscure.
X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated

X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.
X                obfuscatory adj.
X
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X
X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since
X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works
X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.
X    (see ""The New Hacker's Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond)
X
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical
X    closing date for contests are in early May.
X
X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to
X    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines
X    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address
X    above and use the subject 'send rules'.
X
X    One may obtain winners of previous contests (1984 to date), via ftp from:

I have been following this mess for a while. excuse my need for

could not have come at a better time.

the above quote SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip}

are we talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller
or 
are we talking about a SCSI-1 Controller that had a chip upgrade
using the same chip that is on a SCSI-2 controller board.

Black and white.  A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden
agenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an
easy and as straight forward as it reads.

Kent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you.
And it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone.
Me, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one
sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with 
whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  

Jesus uses the word ""men"".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.
Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.
Christians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian 
is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian 
can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought
out into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been
exposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't
seen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been
exposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your
own.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the
Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can
shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know
existed. 

So do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians
are not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the
Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,
and they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far
we have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to
know how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants
to know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth,
which do you choose?

>I'm watching the news about a man who saw the light, and made

And I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, 
who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part
of his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who
died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was
their downfall to death. 

And Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an
excuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.
David Koresh was no light and no excuse for
you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who
claimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh
was born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't
even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.

Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David
Koresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be
aware of imposters 2000 years ago.  

So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to
be Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your
mother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that
simple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar
right from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.
They wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their
ignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant
cost them a lot.

Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you
not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  
Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you
remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt
Eve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, 
was the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,
Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It
didn't work with Jesus.  

Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan
tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what
Koresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?
Who was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what
Satan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did
not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not
the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew
the real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve
choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God
held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None 
of them had an excuse.  

As opposed to the Branch Davidians, we have a second chance.
Follow Jesus and he will escort us to the path of eternal life.
Don't follow Jesus, and you stand condemned already, for like
the Branch Davidian complex, your house is already on fire.
Satan, Adam and Eve have already set it ablaze.   It is just
a slow burn, but it is burning nevertheless.

The best way of self injection is to use the right size needle
and choose the correct spot. For Streptomycin, usually given intra
muscularly, use a thin needle (23/24 guage) and select a spot on
the upper, outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there). 
Clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. Make
sure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when the
needle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when it 
pierces the skin).

PS: Try to go to a doctor. Self-treatment and self-injection should
be avoided as far as possible.

It still applies, except the astronomy these days is Very Long Baseline
Radio Astronomy coupled to GPS and Satellite Laser Ranging. The data
from NASA's and the Naval Observatory's (among others) is a vital 
source of data for studies into crustal dynamics, Earth rotation, and
purturbations. Every time there is a leap second added to the New Year,

Anything that does not bring me closer to God is a sin. 
(If you think this is too strict, just consider how ambiguous it is.)

This implies that staying the same is a sin. A Christian should
never be satisfied. It does not imply that
having fun is a sin. It does not imply that sleeping is a sin.
It does imply that I sin every day.

A perhaps simpler definition:
Anything that is counter to the two Great Commandments: 
love God, love your neighbor, is a sin.
Anything I do that is not from love is a sin.

The same action can be a sin sometimes and not a sin sometimes.

I could yell at my kids as discipline, all the time loving them,
considering only to teach them proper behavior, or I could yell at my
kids out of anger or selfishness.

I could post an excellent article because I am interested in sharing
my opinions and getting feedback and learning, or I could post an
article because I want everyone to realize how wise I am.

The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says;
it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving
commands.  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer, I believe the
probe starts a 'search for Earth' sequence (involving antenna pointing
and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish
communications.  No-ops are sent periodically through those periods
when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows
that we haven't forgotten about it.

Hope that's clear enough to be comprehensible.

They do. According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal
manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and
submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the
police and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police
have stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of
the guns they conficate were illegally built.

It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one
of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing
around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to 
pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's
time for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket
prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least
those few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)

Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled
rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten
times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.
resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and
buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs
and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban 
can not be easily side-stepped.

Sure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in
fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely,
you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer
and get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad
example for your case: How many people do you know with illegal
copies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and
it isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually
get it illegally.

13-3-2. The formula has been around for half a million years.
Or are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and
saltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but
it works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction
in energy (so a .357 magnum would ""only"" be as deadly as a 9mm)
and it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer
could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the
police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known
to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and
reappear on the streets...)

Perhaps you weren't watching the news two years ago, but the Serbs 
also tried to invade Slovinia. They were driven out after a few
weeks by partisans armed with home-made _anti-tank_ weapons.
The Afghan rebels frequently made their own rifles.

Their Hiten engineering-test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric
Earth orbit doing lunar flybys, and then was inserted into lunar orbit
using some very tricky gravity-assist-like maneuvering.  This meant that
it would crash on the Moon eventually, since there is no such thing as
a stable lunar orbit (as far as anyone knows), and I believe I recall
hearing recently that it was about to happen.

For Sale ...:
 
        Hewlett Packard DeskJet 500 inkjet printer.
 
        o Perfect condition both internally and externally
        o Comes with two FULL ink cartridges
        o Less than six months old
        o Comes with all original packaging, manuals, cables
          and software
 
        This is truly an excellent printer and is the low-cost
        alternative to a laser printer.  It prints with the
        quality of a laser printer, but for a fraction of both
        the inital cost and he long term cost (that is,
        replacement of ink cartridges as opposed to replacement
        of toner).  The printer prints at a maximum of 300*300
        (D)ots (P)er (I)nch (D.P.I.) on many different types
        and sizes of paper, including envelopes and
        transperencies.  Printer prints in both landscape and
        portrait modes.  Printer can accept up to two
        cartridges giving it things like more memory or
        additional fonts.  Printer works excellently with
        Windows and DOS and brings TrueType to its full
        potential.
 
        I originally purchased the printer for $375.00.  Make me
        an offer, but I would prefer to stay in the $300.00
        range.  I will pay the shipping to anywhere in the

        P.S. The printer will work with any computer that
             can accept a standard parallel or serial

>What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?
Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with 5MB/s and Hard drives START

For the Mac I have the following {These are ALL external}
 20MB $299 {$15/MB}
 52MB $379 {$7.3/MB}
 80MB $449 {$5.63/MB}
120MB $569-$639 {$4.75-$5.33/MB

320MB $1499-$1549 {$4.68-$4.84/MB}
510MB $1999-$2119 ($3.92-$4.31/MB}
etc

So scsi-1/SCSI-2 for the Mac goes down in price/MB as hard drive size goes
up {and I assume the same for the PC world.}

Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface.  In the Mac {since SCSI is THE
inteface for any non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used
for the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross
drive interfacing as fast as the OS, program, CPU, SCSI, and drive can handle 
it{this shows up best in the Quatra line}.
In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well.
Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers, scanners, expandsion cards 
{this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'}, CD-ROM, etc.
IDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any
and I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface
{Make of that what you will}
SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE.
This alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water.
Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago
{When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played
and SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end
computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI
off into the statosphere price wise}
SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the
standard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it
choose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined
interface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces
{at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}

The equation of the sphere through the 4 points (x1,y1,z1),...,(x4,y4,z4) is

  |      1             1         ...        1        |
When this 5 by 5 determininant is expanded on its first column you get the
equation in the form
  A(x^2+y^2+z^2) + Bx + Cy + Dz + E = 0
If you need the center and radius, jyst divide through by A (it cannot be
zero if the 4 given points form a non-degenerate tetrahedron) and complete
the square on x, y, and z to obtain
  (x-xc)^2 + (y-yc)^2 + (z-zc)^2 = r^2

Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not
_The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't
remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola,
travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when
one of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction
of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven.
But the notion is not pursued further than that.

also occurs in small children on the hands, feet and genitalia.

Any information will be greatly appreciated.

The Vatican, Home Of Genetic Misfits?

Michael  A. Gillow, noted geneticist, has revealed  some unusual  data
after working undercover in  the Vatican for the past 18 years.   ""The
Popehat(tm) is actually an advanced bone spur."", reveals Gillow in his
groundshaking report. Gillow, who had  secretly  studied the innermost
workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair,
first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late
1950's.

""The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up. The  Vatican didn't
want the Catholic Community(tm) to realize  their  leader  was hefting
nearly  8 kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  his
skull."", notes Gillow in his report. ""There are whole  laboratories in
the  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrow
experiments.  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400's is now
scientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant idea
started  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary
transplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats."" Gillow is quick
to point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the
disappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye.

""When it becomes time to replace the pope"", says Gillow, ""The old pope
and the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber. They  butt
heads much  like  male yaks  fighting for dominance of the  herd.  The
victor emerges and has  earned the privilege of inseminating the choir
boys.""

Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they
think of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our 
culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather
than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer 
an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to
treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to
their liking, off they go to another one.

I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different 
perspective on the ""church choosing process"". It seems to me from 1Cor 12
that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all
but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better
question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where
God is trying to place me.

If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they
go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of
God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they
hop from natural family to family.

If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an 
easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more
like an orphan. Prayerfully go and ""leave yourself on a few doorsteps""
and see if anyplace feels like home. 

I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you
have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand
there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking
for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand
if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that
wherever you go. 

In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that
talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is
expanding on that base.

     TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the 
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The 
satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section 
housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof 
mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The 
proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation 
pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered 
around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.

     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 
2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a 
single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be 
powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

     Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in ""Spacecraft Design 
Innovations in the APL Space Department,"" Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, 
Vol. 13, No. 1 (1992).

In response to a lot of email I've gotten, I need to clarify my position.

I am not in favor of paganism.

I am not in favor of the Easter Bunny or other non-Christian aspects of
Easter as presently celebrated.  (Incidentally, Easter eggs are not
non-Christian; they are a way of ending the Lenten fast.)

My point was to distinguish between
  (1) intentionally worshipping a pagan deity, and
  (2) doing something which may once have had pagan associations, but
nowadays is not understood or intended as such.

Many people who are doing (2) are being accused of (1).

It would be illogical to claim that one is ""really"" worshipping a
pagan deity without knowing it.  Worship is a matter of intention.
One cannot worship without knowing that one is doing so.

Dear Rob,

>the truth.  When I read your response here, I see condescension.  When you
>reply to a post, reply to the post you quote.  This statement undermines
>any good points you might have had (it was enough to make me stop reading).

Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that
way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll
try to get better.

Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle
approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,
only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both
cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse
for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.

Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. 
vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is
an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  
I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with
his set of excuses.  

I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants
to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses
which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the
Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being
sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.

From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man
standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I 
see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away
from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see
the dialog:


Me:  ""Brian K, please step aside before you get run over."" 

BK:  ""There is no truck.""

Me:  ""Turn around at look.""

BK:  ""No.""

Me:  ""Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at
     the oncoming truck.""

BK:  ""No. Explain to me why trucks exist.""

Me:  ""Turn around or you will run over.""

BK:  ""No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.""

Me:  ""You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing
      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.""
      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.

BK:  ""It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.
      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.""
      And by the way, I really have an open mind.""


So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   

I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not
billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people
fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.
I can now see the truck behind Brian.

My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the
truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out
of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself
to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if
he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that
to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,
Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he
does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his
head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is
satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. 

Thank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.  (My
wife tells me the same thing at times.)   :-)   I will try to do better.

You don't say whether or not you have any symptoms other than pain.
If you have numbness, weakness or bladder problems, for example,
these would suggest a need for surgery. If pain is your only symptom
you might do well to find a reputable, multi-disciplinary pain
clinic in your area. Chronic low back pain generally doesn't do well
with surgery, acute on chronic pain (as only symptom) doesn't fare
much better.
e correlation between MRI findings and symptoms is controversial.

Well, actually, the Davidians (Koreshians?) started the fire themselves, 
the last I heard ( around 15:00 EST). Eight people ran out into the feilds
surrounding the compound. All were captured and two admitted to setting the 
fire. I don't buy your napalm theory at all (although it would have made a 
great commercial for my .sig). Why the hell would they have a wood stove
burning on such a warm day?  Flame throwers use liquid petroleum, napalm 
is more of a gel. Now to further dispute your theory, the diluted CS gas
was inserted around 06:00 if I understood correctly. The place didn't start
burning until around 10:00 or 11:00.

Calm down kid. Vernon (Koresh's real name) said himself that he would not leave
that compound alive. The inhabitants thereof had accepted the fact that they 
may very well have to kill themselves before it was all over.

  The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared

  I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the
  shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an
  extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to
  test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
  in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this
  transparent.

  The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this

But you have been courteous and therefore received courtesy in return.  This

made from the pro-Christian people.  I've known several Jesuits who would
laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them.

Let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment (nice
word Maddi, original or is it a real word?) and concentrate on the
liar, lunatic part.

The argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands
of people.  Look at L. Ron Hubbard.  Now, he was probably not all there,
but I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  But look at how many
thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology.  I think the 
Baker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all
the time, but look at the number of follower they have.

As for lunatics, the best example is Hitler.  He was obviously insane,
his advisors certainly thought so.  Yet he had a whole country entralled
and came close to ruling all of Europe.  How many Germans gave their lives
for him?  To this day he has his followers.

I'm just amazed that people still try to use this argument.  It's just
so obviously *wrong*.

	I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple
strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)?  Just a strut
going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a
tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?

	Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using
shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening
the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry
will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the
intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom
of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore
the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer
is the only way to go...

MAGI: 

[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
 ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
 _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
 most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
 second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
 the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
 to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]

  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain 
etymology. It may originally have meant ""member of the tribe,"" as in the
Avestan compound mogu-tbish (""hostile to a member of the tribe""). This meaning
would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to ""member of the priestly
tribe"" and perhaps to ""priest"" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is
probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the ""Magoi"" as one of
the six tribes of the Medes.
  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a
priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were
responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their
knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median
priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median
monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century
through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the
Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political
and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced
concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period
(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is
demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by
Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by
Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of
the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.
  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the
sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the
possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be
attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.
  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi
are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of
the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is
untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the
Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, ""gift""), is
not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,
in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of
purity, or separation of the ""mixture"" of the two opposed principles of spirit
and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as ""chorus,"" from
the root mangh, which is said to mean ""sing the magic song"" (Nyberg, 1966) and
has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an
ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though
there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms
magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the
Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite
a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore
the Avestan term for ""priest,"" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is 
perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis 
(Gershevitch, 1964).
  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the
Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in
particular derives from an older form, magupati (""head of the Magi""). During
the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of
a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (""the high priest of
high priests"") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical
hierarchy.
  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,
khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of
the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.
The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons
of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian
community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the
Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this
rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was
in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with
wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples
of Central Asia.
  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to
offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a
ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the
custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the
relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was
called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also
known for the practice of killing harmful, or ""Ahrimanical,"" animals (khrafstra)
such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,
tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of
felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose
and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their
breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition
that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was
that of the priesthood: white.
  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in
possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they
gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of
professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally
inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been
jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this
they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible
for teaching the prince the ""magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes"" and thus
the ""cult of the gods."" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with
the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and
master of himself.
  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great
influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite
several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of
Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself
Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -
the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,
in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed
as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.
  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were
renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of
the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men
who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in
Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were
also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;
this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,
like ""goes,"" ""expert in the magic arts"" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the
Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and
had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.
  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it
is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called
western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must
have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the
Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in
contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in
varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.
  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their
varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical
historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their
customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,
belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology
and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi
even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the
Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted
Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and
placed themselves under his venerable name.
  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the
eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those
elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite
often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the
Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, ""the law-abjuring
daivas""), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of
texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and
practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first
chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the
supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;
Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of
all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the
land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it
has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the
absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own
priesthood, would be very strange.
  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the
corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the
first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute
directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to
us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of
the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles
of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (""beneficent
spirit"") and Angra Mainyu (""hostile spirit"") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra
Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-
formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-
astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the
Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known
to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can
see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which
we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]
  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously
important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in
the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their
natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of
Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began
to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,
Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises
on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have
survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of
wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority
of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an
abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).
  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]
  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the
religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,
1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of
Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to
establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an
orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures
in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar
and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.

SAOSHYANT:
  The Avestan term saoshyant (""future benefactor""; MPers., soshans) designates
the savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.
The concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-
astrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.
Zarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-
shyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present
state of the world, when existence will be ""rehabilitated"" and ""made splendid.""
[See Frashokereti]
  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological
myth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors
are born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in
Lake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),
protected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited
Saoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (""he who embodies truth""), the son of
the Vispataurvairi (""she who conquers all""), is the third, who will make
existence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will
no longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted
unlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will
be immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the
powerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and
of asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and
render it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with
the forces of evil, which will be destroyed.
  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation
(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, ""he who makes
truth grow,"" and Ukhshyatnemah, ""he who makes reverence grow""; the names of the
three virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra
when they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally
speculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a
millennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will
appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.
  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid
period (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element
in the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining
factor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the
confines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,
Maitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace
its roots to the same source.

If this theory were true, the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy

Instead, the biopsy shows scattered, angulated, atrophic fibers.
This is more consistent with load-shedding by chronically overworked
motor neurons - the neurons survive, at the expense of increasingly

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever
scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on 
the frontend.

Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm
equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets
dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly
12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big no-no.

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??

This is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you
get the idea.  Choose a high-efficiency LED so you don't need much
current to get it to light up.  Choose values for the other components
as required.

I was *hoping* somebody would mention clutch.  Clutch?  Baerga?  The
two words simply do not go together.  With runners in scoring
position, Baerga batted .308/.366/.418 last year.  This doesn't quite
*suck*, but most batters hit *better* in this situation.

Alomar?  He hit .354/.439/.517 with runners in scoring position!

The difference?  Alomar had 68 RBIs in 147 such AB.  Baerga had 81
RBIs in 182 such AB.  Baerga got 25% more chances, yet succeeded only
20% more times.

Frankly, I don't believe in clutch.  But if I did, my vote would
go to Alomar for MVP (let alone ""best 2B in the AL"").

Hola amigos,

Quiero... I need an answer to a pressing question.  I now own two
bikes and would love to keep them both.  One is a capable and
smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great
brakes; the other is a Beemer G/S, kind of rough for the city but
great on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, but
I don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is going
to pluck me by the short hairs.  

Unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  They
do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of 
driving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage
to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left...
accelerate the Zephyr; turn right... accelerate the Beemer.)  Does
anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to
discount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.

By the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes
there, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebody
guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson
they only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,
per annum.

For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel
for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the
contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be
worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest
heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I
don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.

But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a
low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General
Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper
stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two
unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. 
Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9
billion for the US share.

I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that
its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric
tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew
habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for
the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be
able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,
that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors
eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or
college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round
this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton
payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two
LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a
year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of
delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone
have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and
equipment would weigh?

And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded
to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? 
Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10
engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? 
I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the
DC-1.

All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the
moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first
non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned
moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find
some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal
might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared
to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary
about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd
like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.

Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an
English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on
the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar
flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine. 
Does this ring a bell to anyone?

Subject: New break pads & exhausts after 96K km (60K mi) on '90 Maxima?
Organization: CSRI, University of Toronto
Lines: 43


Hi, maybe someone can help me here...
I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now.
The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it.
A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi).
The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification
he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced
to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before
selling the car to me.)

Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know
what this could mean...
Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items?
Or is this an indication that the car was abused?
Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?
The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but,
I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away
in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.

Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and
well kept, it's currently out of warranty
(a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km
worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for
any repair bills...
But, I also need a car for 5 people...  

When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?

I would very much appreciate your input in this.
Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup.
Thanks!

My fiance is Lutheran and I am Catholic.  We plan on getting married in
her church because she is living there now and I plan on moving there
in a month or so.  I called my Catholic priest to find out what I needed
to do in order for the marriage to be recognized by my church.

Needless to say that I have found that there is no ""hard and fast"" rule
when it comes to how the Catholic law for interfaith weddings is interpreted.
But I'm pretty sure that we CAN get married without too much problem; the
trick lies in the letter of dispensation.

But that is not why I am here....

What I'd like to know is: 
  What are the main differences between the Lutheran and Catholic religions?
  My priest mumbled something about how the Eucharist was understood...
  I have heard that if two religions combine soon, it would be these two.

Any help would be appreciated...

Thanks so much!

Bill

To put it mildly.  As I watched the Flyers demolish Toronto last night, 4-0,
I realized that no matter how good the Leafs' #1 line may be, they'll need
one or two more decent lines to go far in the playoffs.  And, of course, a
healthy Felix Potvin.

Also would maybe get the Russians Involved. After all they do have the resources
to do it in part.. But they need the capital and the goal..

I wonder if renting the russians resources would be a disqualification?

Insofar as several ""liberal"" jurisdictions are concerned, the essential
elements of rape are gender neutral. Nonetheless, I decided to provide
a number of references to support my original argument. Black's Law
Dictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful
sexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful
knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model
Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners
of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures)
defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife
is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of
imminent death.... (MPC @213.1(1)(a))

Indeed the following jurisdictions/states have statutes similar to the MPC:

Alabama-- Code of Ala. @13A-6-61 (1992)
Arkansas--Ark.Stat.Ann. @5-14-103 (1993)
District of Columbia--D.C. Code @22-2801 (1992)
Georgia--O.F.G.A. @16-6-1 (1992)
Idaho--Idaho Code @18-6101 (1992)
Maryland--Md.Ann.Code.Art. 27 @462 (1992)
Mississippi--Miss.Code Ann. @97-3-71 (1993)

While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the
sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM,
it is only ""relatively"" recent that the Windows drivers for this card
have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are
STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,
mis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.
If there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would
drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their
BBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother
notifying me of fixes/releases.

Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the ""right"" person in curing
some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting
addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the
Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep
explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not
confirmed the validity of that statement.

When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some
form of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than
Diamond.

	In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and

	Samadhi means ``fixed mind.'' The Vedic dictionary, the Nirukti,
says, samyag adhiyate 'sminn atma-tattva-yathatmyam: ``When the mind is
fixed for understanding the self, it is said to be in samadhi.''
Samadhi is never possible for persons interested in material sense
enjoyment, nor for those who are bewildered by such temporary things.
They are more or less condemned by the process of material energy.

nice theory.  too bad the MR2's never came with a four cylinder over 2.0
liters.  More like 1.6.  Or did they? were the nonturbo MR2II's  2.2 or
some such?

I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders, must
pay SAAB a royalty for using their patented design..like Porsche's 3.0 I4...

Yeah - they also gave it their ""Editor's Choice"" in the run-down of
graphics accelerators they tested in the previous issue, which is why
I bought (and then returned) mine.  The only conclusion I can come up with
is that PC Magazine has wildly different ways on determining the worthiness
of a video card than I do.

Yes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun 
militia.  But the difinition of modify that applies to how ""well regulated"" 
modifies ""militia"" is:
	to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, ""wet""
	modifes ""day"" in the phrase ""a wet day.""

The amendment is similiar to the statement:
	A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep
	and wear boots, shall not be infringed.
So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar,
what does the ""unorganized militia"" have to due with the right to
own guns?

No not, unconditional, but ""shall not be infringed"".  Infringed
is defined as:
	To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath, 
	an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.
	To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach.
This definition implies the following of some form of existing 
agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries 
or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word 
""unconditional"" implies no agreements or all previous agreements 
are off, which is the opposite.

The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e.,
""congress shall make no law,"" are much stronger.  They clearly 
	         ^^^^^^^^^^^
imply ""unconditional.""  If the writers of the amendment, wanted 
unconditional whay didn't they says, ""congress shall make no 
laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms""?
The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people
the people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is
the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws
at any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped
the people from forming a ""well regutaled militia.""  The duties
of a ""well regulated militia"" to the government are descussed in 
Federalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental control
of the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8, Article II 
Section 2, and the Second Amendment of the constitution.

After reading the first paragraph, a quick scan confirmed my first
impression: this is a bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash.

The NY Times reported on April 18, 1993 that the museum ""was built
through private contributions on Federal land"".  Your hate-mongering
article is devoid of current and historical fact, intellectual content
and social value.  Down the toilet it goes.....

I have a new 25 MHz Motorola 68040 that I am willing to sell if I get
a good enough offer.  It is still in its static free sealed package.

If I don't get a good enough offer, I will use it to replace my 68LC040.

Any takers?  

Supposedly you can get one of these for $375.  However, at the moment the
demand is higher than the supply so I think $400 is a good round number.
I will pay shipping, of course.

One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG
channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.
If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be
sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per
channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should
be rather easy to accomplish.

Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without
generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is
in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to
keep balanced.

A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with
a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.
Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws
govern the use of transeivers in your location.

Hi there

I am very interested in Rayshade 4.00. I have managed to make a chessboard
for Rayshade. Unfortunately I still have to do the knight (horse). Any ideas?
I am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces. The board is marble.
Unfortunately black won't work very well for the one side. Anybody with ideas
for nice surfaces?

I would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield
command. Unfortunately the manual is very vague about this, and I don't have
Craig Kolb's email address. Anybody with ideas, because this is essential
for my next venture into raytracing.

Where should I post the finished chessboard?

Is there anybody else using rayshade on non-Unix systems?

How fast does Unix render?

Thanks

Rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics, but have no
artistic talent.

Yes, that's true, but you have to be clear exactly what is
an uninterpreted observation. It's pretty low level stuff.
'The sun shines' is already a LOT higher level than that. We

Huh? What do you mean 'all in the same situation?' Let's take me

but I think we can agree as to whether it's day or night. I don't

Kovalev is too talented a player to play for Roger Nielson...Roger needs
players who can't think for themselves and can only skate in straight
lines up and down the ice.  Dudley and Nielson are the only two coaches
bad enough in the league to take talents like Mogilny and Kovalev and
not know how to turn them into Bure and Selanne.

Get Muckler as coach, and Kovalev will look like Mogilny.

The trouble with the Rangers is that Neil Smith went out and got
players like Messier, Kovalev, and Graves who have been schooled in
taking the game to their opponent and attacking, while hiring coaches
who are interested in ""rope-a-dope"" strategies.  If you want the
Roger Nielsons of the world to be your coach you don't go out and
get a Mark Messier, who is an old dog who can't learn new tricks
from a known loser, and you don't waste your draft picks on players
like Kovalev.

I've sent the article.  In terms of the group discussion, I wanted to point
out that ""non-liberal education"" (head in the sand) is not the same as
""abstinence education"".

We had ""non-liberal education"" regarding drugs when I was a kid in the 60's,
which didn't do us a lot of good.  But ""abstinence education"" regarding
drugs has proven effective, I think.

My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our
first child (due June 15th).  We interviewed a young doctor last week
and were very impressed with her.  However, I discovered that she is
actually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a ""Doctor of 
Osteopathy"" (D.O.).  What's the difference?  I believe the pediatrician
*I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from
any other doctor I've seen over the years.

My dictionary says that osteopathy is ""a medical therapy that emphasizes
manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought
to cause disease and inhibit recovery.""

Jeez, this sounds like chiropractic.  I remember getting shots and
medicine from *my* pediatrician D.O., and don't remember any 
""manipulative techniques"".  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to
the real, practical difference between an M.D. and a D.O.  Also, I'm
interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who
follows one or the other medical philosophy.

As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
question ""WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?"" I must assume
that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it
and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she 
believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.  
(Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the
idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the 
food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG
be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit
forming) ?

This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my
children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some
sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:
Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet
food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in 
pet food?

No. When the program is run, it loads 4 configuration files; autoexec.bat,
config.sys, win.ini, and system.ini. There is no Open entry on the File
menu. You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other
program's .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor.

I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was
just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The
reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals
about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry
under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for
internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice
multi-file replacement for Notepad.

Hi,

I've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few 
concerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing 
her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) 
and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every 
4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. 
As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that 
though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she 
mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 
weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had 
an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no 
problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain 
in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very 
difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or 
move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for 
when I do need to go out.) 

Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from 
the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about 
2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  
(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating 
very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well 
now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile 
related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my 
upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I 
was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because 
it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  
no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I 
ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had 
turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if 
I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it 
wasn't as much of a problem.

So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid 
fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware 
of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have 
been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat 
foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  

But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat 
except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, 
fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I 
should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only 
have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( 
potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in 
a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or 
steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have 
some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if 
I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it 
from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if 
she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her 
recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on 
cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She 
originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the 
entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I 
started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and 
she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also 
asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them 
are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, 
and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did 
want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be 
temporary for that one week. 

What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I 
would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying 
that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she 
assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that 
because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to 
use the energy from the food I do eat. 

Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm 
truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet 
because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few 
minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I 
don't find any foods satisfying.

Thanks

Correction:  All Billy is promising is that it will run 'most' Windows 3.1

Brent shows his ignorance once again.  Power had been cut for weeks.  And he's  
never lived in a rural area if he thinks electric stoves have favor there.   
They stop working when the power fails, and power restoration come MUCH slower  
in the country, than the city.  LP gas stoves and ovens are very much prefered.

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in 
exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an 
endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure 
of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but 
fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have 
comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former, 
in the long term, unless you have the latter.

One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird 
cross between a libertarian and an ""establishment tool"" is that I end up 
taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when 
the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my 
lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.  

As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government 
to be ""fair"".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed, 
whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the 
government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.  
What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal, 
so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong) 
sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth 
it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its 
citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the 
major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a 
couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it 
would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I 
agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly 
participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a 
strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.  
I've already written off politics.

And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive 
faster than 55 MPH, too.

I have a 486DX33 ISA system with 4 meg.  I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor
video card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am
running Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping
the program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure
is very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,
very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.

The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it
does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this
slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there
something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?

Thanks.

For Immediate Release                             April 14, 1993     

	     
                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                      AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE

	     	  
                            Hyatt Regency
                        Crystal City, Virginia  


11:22 A.M. EDT

	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that 
Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today 
about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to 
get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature 
of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of 
people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of 
those who are here.  
	     
	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education 
and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my 
good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and 
all of the business and local community leaders from the city and 
county and state level from around America who are here. 
	     
	     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved 
hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is 
their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A 
year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because 
I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our 
country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had 
too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines 
of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to 
take us into the future.  
	     
	     I entered with the hope that together we could create 
more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of 
our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of 
America's community, knowing that together we could always to more 
than we could individually and that we might secure our future.
	     
	     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 
jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the 
commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, 
and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs 
does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this 
stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all 
those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're 
on the right track.
	     
	     Last July when I was traveling across America's 
heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in 
Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business 
people who were participating in the Louisville Education and 
Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  
I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed 
both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my 
own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about 
-- that for millions of American young people it is really an 
impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good 
workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what 
is learning.
	     
	     In the world in which we are living, the average young 
person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a 
lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning 
world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young 
people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased 
here today.  
	     
	     Whether you're in business or in government or in 
education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to 
building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all 
of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things 
are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best 
thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have 
jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  
	     
	     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty 
good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that 
they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either 
political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great 
challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to 
fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work 
for them to do.
	     
	     All the European countries have higher unemployment 
rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the 
unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  
They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its 
most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that 
I have proposed to create jobs. 
	     
	     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now 
about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  
It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of 
pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing 
their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their 
people.  
	     
	     But it is especially important for America for two 
reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move 
aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be 
competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, 
even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed 
of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to 
work in this country.  (Applause.)
	     
	     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some 
of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and 
moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We 
have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big 
organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they 
are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working 
at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to 
create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the 
chance to work.  
	     
	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare 
reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of 
months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the 
end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of 
the American people to perform without regard to race or income or 
the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that 
there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their 
talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  
I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if 
you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more 
responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this 
country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you 
have got to have opportunity in that mix. 
	     
	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for 
every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules 
and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be 
something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are 
basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, 
recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of 
our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their 
background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's 
something there for them to do?

	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an 
integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of 
work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people 
first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private 
sector.
	     
	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in 
February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 
extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the 
American business community to meet that target so that we can create  
more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been 
created before.
	     
	     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And 
Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in 
this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more 
than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people 
a work experience.  And it is terribly important.
	     
	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is 
part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the 
American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their 
jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving 
the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to 
college but do need at least two years of post-high school training 
either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, 
so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more 
people to go on to college who do want to go.
	     
	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive 
plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The 
emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would 
create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and 
that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It 
would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work 
force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.
	     
	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to 
invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --
projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, 
new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities 
-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve 
the environment.  
	     
	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that 
because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the 
Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching 
out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer 
jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to 
hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young 
people into further educational opportunities and to further job 
opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component 
to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government 
has never fully emphasized before.  
	     
	     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because 
they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in 
difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building 
their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other 
areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who 
have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what 
they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next 
year.  
	     
	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the 
opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning 
skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next 
couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school 
in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning 
environment.  
	     
	     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities 
for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this 
will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will 
be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new 
work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.
	     
	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-
work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding 
the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help 
to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve 
local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public 
buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in 
hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, 
and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while 
they earn, but letting them earn.
	     
	     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people 
who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should 
do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the 
opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing 
in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't 
exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare 
system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people 
to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the 
use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if 
you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to 
reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     The young people we propose to put to work under our 
program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, 
reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will 
stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a 
sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, 
but a challenge that will take them into a different life.
	     
	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even 
as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the 
summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll 
see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer 
academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved 
ahead.  I suspect that they will.  
	     
	     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I 
will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn 
from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next 
summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school 
year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that 
we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so 
that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private 
investments as well. 
	     
	     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the 
business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this 
summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business 
who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who 
haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about 
this event today, I want to implore other private employers to 
stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this 
summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when 
we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort 
them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)
	     
	     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up 
here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking 
about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've 
done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very 
foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand 
and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had 
ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be 
worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     That does not mean young people should not be 
entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation 
ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and 
worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  
And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some 
people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  
	     
	     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I 
grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul 
without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a 
job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to 
people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a 
job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now 
I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any 
more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're 
working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  
And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these 
young people want.
	     
	     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  
It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration 
pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private 
sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn 
how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created 
in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done 
off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a 
third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do 
economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of 
America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just 
kidding.  
	     
	     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy 
country in the world, including the United States, is having 
difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done 
I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole 
deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the 
answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to 
Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the 
counties, through the Community Development Program, with the 
infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an 
attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the 
economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little 
boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a 
million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.
	     
	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in 
the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government 
money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American 
economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind 
of system we have and it works pretty well.  
	     
	     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you 
here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends 
and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers 
to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the 
funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government 
should create this summer, so that together we can have this 
partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a 
future -- a future that our young people can believe in.  
	     
	     We need to send them a message that here in America if 
you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute 
something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  
You can build a future from you own dreams. 
	     
	     That has always been the promise of America.  Together 
that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of 
the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise 
has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.
	     
	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What
I disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to
ruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is
the most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe
I realize that incidences such as the one described in the
letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to
ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the
Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think
that might be a reason they report more clearly on the
atrocities.
	What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of
the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing
received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt
go away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races

all of my HO's disagree with your HO's.  I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick..
detested it in the auto(like i did any other time in the auto...).  Of course,
Dalls rush hours are nothing, from what i hear..if i lived in LA, i might
be of a different persuasion.  And, just for the record, rarely do you shift
gears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th is
good up through around 80-90, most of the time, so you can just wind it out..
it's not going to hurt anything, and keeps it in the powerband anyway..
only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th(fairly rare,
unless you drive a ferrari or some such, i'd bet) or when you hit cruising 
speed where you feel comfortable(or when my mother is sitting in the 
passanger seat complaining about how you wind her ""poor little engine"" way

        Well as for team captains being traded
        in there first year in the NHL the
        Edmonton Oilers traded their captain
        Ron Chiperfield to the Quebec Nordique
        right at the trading deadline for 
        Goaltender Ron Lowe
        In their second year of existence
        The Edmonton Oilers again right at the trade 
        deadline traded their captain, this time 
        B.J. McDonald to the Vancouver Canucks
        along with the rights to winger Ken 
        Berry for Garry Lariviere and the rights 
        to Lars Gunner Petterson 
        
        as for more captain trivia, the next Edmonton
        captain was Lee Fogilin who was later traded to
        the Buffalo Sabres, after him was Wayne Gretzky
        who was traded to L A, then came Kevin Low who
        only this year was traded to the N Y Rangers
        so that every captain the Edmonton Oilers have had
        has been traded.

        The present captain is Craig McTavish and we'll
        just have to wait and see.


        well talk to you later

 This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the 
 belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist.
 This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are
 conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have
 to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe
 in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at
 God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan
 except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond
 hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The 
 reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians
 have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.

  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a 
  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and
  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least
  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this
  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because
  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the
  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict
  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant
  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists
  can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).

>though it's less arrogant and pompous.

 Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist
 doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may
 just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:
 
 Strong atheism - ""I believe god does not exist""   a positive belief

 Weak atheism   - ""I don't believe in a god""       a negative belief
 
 these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of
 god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that
 you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)
 
 suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent
 as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas
 exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person
 not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that
 even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:
 
 christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god
 
 atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)
 
 atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set
 
 agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....)

 Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not
  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always 
  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival
  trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.

Actually, Jerry Brown essentially did...and Clinton, in his demagogue
persona, condemned Brown for it in the crucial NY primary last year.

However....

Why don't the Republicans get their act together, and say they
will support a broad-based VAT that would have to be visible
(the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they
have in Europe)
and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate
and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give
the Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform, and
force an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax
rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could
be increased only via a national referendum.

Why not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile...
shift the tax burden from investment to consumption, and get
health care reform, and a frozen low top marginal tax rate
all in one fell swoop.

It looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European

Ranford, Tugnutt, Benning, Manson, Smith, Buchberger, and Corson
are playing for Canada.

Podein and Weight are playing for the US.

Is Kravchuk playing for the Russians...I know he had nagging
injuries late in the season.

Podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to
play in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev, Zubov,
and Andersson...obviously Sather and Pocklington are not
the total scrooges everyone makes them out to be...certainly
in this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the

     The Nicene Creed, as I mentioned above, is a brief statement of
     beliefs that are derived from Scripture. That this certain list

Typical Mutlu.  PvdL asks if X happened, the response is that Y
happened.  Even if we grant that the Armenians *did* do what Cosar
accuses them of doing, this has no bearing on whether the Turks did
what they are accused of.

While I can understand how an AI could be this stupid, I
can't understand how a human could be such a moron as to either let
such an AI run amok or to compose such pointless messages himself.

I do not expect any followup to this article from Argic to do anything
to alleviate my puzzlement.  But maybe I'll see a new line from his
list of insults.

At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and
imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the
case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason
to believe it still goes on.

Read this:

From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992

PUBLICATION BAN

        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many
        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were
        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of
        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever
        being made public.

By Baruch Me'iri

All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way
or another: ""Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I
will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific
case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something
which may legally not be published"".

The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years
there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to
long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the
crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More
precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of
their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.

In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of
this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about
the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,
for security offenses, in complete secrecy.

In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]
affair -- we heard about ""the third man"" being in prison.  But many
years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no
longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former
Communist countries.

But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.

The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and
Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this
week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet
Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:

""During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been
imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of
these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the
specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but
even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after
being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison
without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the
prisoner"", asserts MK Zucker.

On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, ""There is
absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is
imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of
security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases
the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances
under which a trial will not be held in public.

""However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on
the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person
sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of
Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to
know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public
sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.""

Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of
Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider
the question.  ""The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the
cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The
State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention
and its cause is kept secret"", wrote Zucker.

The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai
Shiffman said that, ""We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any
cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,
and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation
which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like
censorship is an unhealthy matter"".

""The Union is aware"", says Shiffman, ""of cases where notification of a
suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am
speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee
was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole
first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.

""The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --
can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where
the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The
journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is
happy...""

Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the
laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a
person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. 
""Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's
that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long
years in prison without us knowing anything about it.""

-- Do you find this situation acceptable?

Attorney Arnon: ""Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and
such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that
publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but
total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of
Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged
with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The
trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for
those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,
though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least
are aware of his imprisonment.""

-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the
discretion of the court?

Attorney Arnon: ""The judges have no choice but to trust the
presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to
investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which
they can misuse.""

-- And what if there really is a security issue?

Attorney Arnon: ""I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.
 Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible
to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without
entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning
publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller
murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the
matter being made public.""

Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can
be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's
arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  ""A healthy
situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere
publication may be harmful to state security"".

A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former
advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda
Meir.  ""Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such
situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must
be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom
of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom
which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.

""Nevertheless"", adds Shtendal, ""the legislator allowed for the
possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the
damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that
which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned.
The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with
the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which
we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has
been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.""

Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: ""As a rule, clearly such a
phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in
the most extreme circumstances.""

DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers, known as 3D accelerators.
This boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to
handle, thus they set this limit.

Lines: 69
NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu
Summary: Instructions for Quadra 700 memory installation
Keywords: memory,quadra,700,install

This is turning into a FAQ


Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own
memory.

1)  Insert usual disclaimer here
 
2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back
	of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM
    slots.

9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to
    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their
	chips facing the front of the motherboard.
	
    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in
	sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely
	and firmly into a fully upright position.
	
10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

12) Replace the phillips head screw

13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount

   Yeah, the ""Feingold Diet"" is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADD
   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
   social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents
   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
   children's development.  So much for the value of ""interesting anecdotal
   results"".  People will believe anything if they want to.

Thanks for all the interest in this problem of mine. I don't think it
is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown
any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food.
She has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.

The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made
by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to
something in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in our
immediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, running
nose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family history
including some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms. 

Anyway, our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the body
chemistry.  But so far, no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizures
either.  Every day that goes by without one makes me heave a sigh of
relief.  Thanks again.

	First of all, without wanting to sound nagging and bossy, yes it is
a trivial answer and that's perfectly fine ( otherwise how is one supposed
to move up to the complicated and challenging questions, we net readers so
much enjoy :) ?), and the massive crossposting of your article was not
 justified...
Please refer to appropriate newsgroups next time (by the way c.o.msw.misc is
OK :) ). Now as far as your problem is concerned: try playing around with
the settings in the 'Fonts..."" dialog box under the window control menu (that
little square at the top left corner of the window..).

 If a large Malmute counts then yes someone has heard(and seen) such
an irresponsible childish stunt. The dog needed assistance straightening
out once on board. The owner would lift the front legs of dog and throw
them over the driver/pilots shoulders. Said dog would get shit eating
grin on its face and away they'd go. The dogs ass was firmly planted
on the seat.
 
 My dog and this dog actively seek each other out at camping party's.
They hate each other. I think it's something personal.

Subject: converting keyboard for mac plus
Organization: Illinois State University
Lines: 35

 
I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.
It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with
a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you
very much).
 
well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus
but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my
local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell
me the order of the wires.
 
there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know
one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and
i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your
experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.
 
btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it
has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes). Oh, well . . .

Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket A/C units.  I have a Frost-King or Frost-Temp
(forget which) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier, and am quite unhappy with
it.  The fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air.  I will never have
an aftermarket A/C installed in any of my vehicles again.  I just can't
trust the quality and performance after this experience.

If I remember rightly PKU syndrome in infants is about 1/1200 ? They lack
two genes. And people who lack one gene are supposed to be 1/56 persons?
Those with PKU have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine. And those
who only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed to
be producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame. 

The methol, formaldahyde thing was supposed to occur with heating?

I don't drink it. I figure sugar was made for a reason. To quickly and
easily satiate hungry people. If you don't need the calories it's just as
easy to drink water.  Used to drink a six pack a aday of aspartame soda. Don't
even drink one coke a day when sugared.

: In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a

I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is
interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on
the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,
is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human
activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or
ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure
from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.

: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must

: So, back to the original question:

: And objective morality is.....?

This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.
Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and
absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of
people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The
concept supposedly described may have meaning however. 
If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then
He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His
existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this
being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has
defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,
He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically
self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an
objective sense.
If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.
If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that
standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative
morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,
meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to
misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to
meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.
Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is
infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself
doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural
norm, or the preferred conduct of ""decent"" people, making it seem
subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.
Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true
nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being
contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as

much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it

Clemens is going on his normal four days' rest (last pitched Saturday). 
Hesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon, his first outing
since an aborted 1-1/3 inning start 6 days before, so he should be plenty
rested to go in his expected turn this Saturday, as the 5th starter.  Not
that this is a good thing, of course.  I'd like to see a well-managed
four-man rotation with this team...

Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and
has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour
of this statement, shouldn't we?

Perhaps the biggest ""imperfection"" of the code is that it is full
of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they
intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of
evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is
likely that early exons represented early protein domains.

Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that
intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually
have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. 

On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted
later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed
by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,
if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have
required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,
since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are
conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a
trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and
these are not found in or near intron sequences. 

I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and
genetics before posting ""theological arguments"" like this. 
Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish
& Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.

: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does
: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a
: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely
: scientific perspective, just different.

Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas 
theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.
 
: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,
: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.

For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support
your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific
perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.

In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps
more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might
have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by
computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) 
 
: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma
: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.

In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although
it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. 

: Actually, neither of us ""knows"" what the atmosphere was like at the
: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most
: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after
: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth
: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I
: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for
: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?

I'd replace ""created"" with ""formed"", since there is no need to 
invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.
Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8
billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but
organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.
This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to
evolve.

I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course
on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.

Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for
this supposed ""degeneration""?

I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests 
everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against
this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in 
anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the 
right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,
and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this. 

Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt
it could ever come to right conclusions.

You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses
do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of
a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators
from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to 
survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it 
to the present. 

And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that
human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have
claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,
and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either
claim.

He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,
it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are
just as inevitable as any product of evolution.

: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject
: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not
: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic

I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.
I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed
free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer
is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.

What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?
  
: Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)

A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.

: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are
: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain
: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain
: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.

Why is there a ""why behind""? And your proposition was something
that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend
these books.

Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence
for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without
any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)
suggest, why do people still insist on this?

I'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,
and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.
It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.

The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set
ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have
EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.

Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user
programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The
more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip
varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing
the EPROM array to light.

What do you mean by ""police band"" - there is no such thing.

Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands.
If you applied your test, all of those radar operated door
openers in malls would be illegal.

One of the great problems here is that there are too many
ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws
about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well
be laws refereing to ""police bands"", they are almost certainly
local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning,
but incompetent idiots.

Unfortunaltely, laws do not have to be sensible (or even enforceable).
Lawmakers exist to pass laws - and will continue to do so, until
the day where you are faced with death for not doing X, and
amputation of all your limbs for doing X ... the choice will be yours.

Excuse me?  Are the Jets playing .500 hockey?  Let me check...yes - but just
barely.  They have allowed more goals than they have scored.  Sounds an
awful lot like Salami's +/- to me.  Sounds like they would be just as well
off - or better - if he played the solid two-way game that our friends in

Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he

I don't believe it!  You did compare him to Foligno!  (And I honestly hadn't

It would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking.  Your

Any advice on HOW to buy a Land Cruiser? My local Toyota dealer says they

Forget about a test drive or even kicking the tires.

Your last remark is a contradiction, but I'll let that pass.

I was addressing the notion of the Great Commission, which
you deleted in order to provide us with dull little homilies.
Thank you, Bing Crosby.  Now you go right on back to sleep
and mommy and daddy will tuck you in later.

Oh, and how convenient his bible must have been to Michael
Griffin, how convenient his Christianity.  ""Well, I'll just

and hating the sin and all that other stuff for now and
concentrate on the part where it says that if someone is doing

I'll leave the ""convert or die"" program of the missionaries and
their military escorts in the Americas for Nadja to explain as
she knows much more about it than I.

  That's true, but according to your stats, Chicago has just as good a

See, there you go again, saying that a moral act is only significant

You are attaching too many things to the term ""moral,"" I think.
Let's try this:  is it ""good"" that animals of the same species
don't kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right? 

Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they do
is either right nor wrong?

Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sort
of mating ritual or whatnot.

Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  What
do you mean by ""consider?""  Can a small child be moral?  How about
a gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Does
the being need to be self aware?

What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of
the same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don't
you find the fact that they don't at all significant?

Just a thought on resources,  It is very important if you do use a
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources.  I have
used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource
converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially
the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets.
With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance,
this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK,
and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So 
your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the
proper resource identifier.
I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does
use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to
port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel
for anything )

	Well here is my $0.02 worth.  Advice from a grad student.

	I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.
The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and 
learn as much as possible about it.  

	In my five years of education in this field, though brief 
compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of 
question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into
Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or
CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this
kind of question is irrelevant.  
 
	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one 
does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does
not like to program is really doing an injustice of building
and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything
is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a 
part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.

	My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision
based on which major will give you the best opportunities to 
learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your 
persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to
explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the
school would make a student choose a major before her/his
sophamore year.                  

	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you 
decided to learn all about the making of computers in which 
case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.

	About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you
are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. 
If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  
Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.

Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks
Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)


Folks,

Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal
carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled ""Armed Force.""  I
felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat
that ""A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.""  I sent
the following to the WSJ.

-----

Gun Stats & Mortal Risks

Preston K. Covey


	Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~
2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns
in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King
County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more
likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to
kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it
has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated
by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of
the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine
(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping
firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ 
 
	Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of
bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: 
What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither
the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the
risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control
do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of
cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the
risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful
here. 

	The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us
off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a
misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice
and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far
outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your
car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or
an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not
take the bus?  

	Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company
of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at
stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:

	The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the
number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense
(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed
by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation
is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other
cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12
accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided
by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King
County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of
homes unaccounted.

	The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on
six counts:

	1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or
acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and
neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is
that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,
dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,
but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are
relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the
calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless
Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is
criminological hogwash.

	2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs
populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories
-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited
by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities
like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is
very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but
avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with
histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and
certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious
risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as
ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither
gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or
vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver
crucially affect the risk. 

	3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is
that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill
than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of
personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike
Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43
times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this
particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about
whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by
tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question
begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any
case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal
instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths
are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility
obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by
gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to
NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. 
People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their
homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection
course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and
sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death
as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard
and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they
disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and
other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we
resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose
norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign
us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in
the matter.

	4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the
NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,
including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total
death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other
studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from
homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these
suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true
that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously
true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these
suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of
research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is
wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce
L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,
1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of
Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of
the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to
~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the
causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a
profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally
disregard this issue.

	5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable
rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the
NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. 
But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled
self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case
dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of
justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story
on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women
who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,
1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic
cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were
reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported
that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In
Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error
by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged
by promulgators of the NEJM statistic. 

	6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation
are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The
divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not
aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even
shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the
coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy
is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure
the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as
opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or
deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where
no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed
to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the
compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by
criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,
Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?
	Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are
based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is
high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare
better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance
or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year
by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and
accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable
statistic than the NEJM scare stat:  

A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or
other crime than to kill anybody.   

	Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;
what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We
should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation
of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. 
Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by
uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we
can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we
hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.

     Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66?  True,
Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,
these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with
lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas
Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.
     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb
pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a
chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no
pitching.  At least, to me.
     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team
with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real
order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but
with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)
Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,
Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.
     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by
seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in
their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all
the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all
the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.
     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-
time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results
I would love to see that.

A couple of months ago I went to a dealership to test drive a car.  Afterwards,
we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the
one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like
I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and
signed the deal.

Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected
to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred
over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would
have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the
price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for 
6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good
example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too
bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would
no longer be in business.  

The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the
salesman said was, ""Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out
how much profit I should make.""  The deal went through with no problems.

OK...I've heard rumors about this...I might have even seen it in a few places.
And I'd like some info...Is it possible to embed fonts in a document (Like 
Write, Word, or Ami Pro?) so the file can be printed on another machine that
doesn't have the font?  If possible, how is it done?

I'm sorry if this is a faq...I couldn't find a faq list...I would also 
apreciate knowing where that is...if a windows faq exsists.

Thanks in advance

I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working
code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method
looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in 
Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.

I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor
of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either
case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution
of linear equations).

To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,
P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the ""normalized"" vector from P1 to P2.
These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting
center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points
(for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like
I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which
will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to
find).

Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets
of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define
the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the
lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique
point if they are not parallel.

NNTP-Posting-Host: sipi.usc.edu

Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some
help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in
addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray
level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to
format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial
problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4
bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the
256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they
did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but
they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they
would call Japan, etc.

Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images
from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not
like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on
getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would
greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

Thanks.

Sunny,

I asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my 650 on 
it's side.  I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I 
trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the 
least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a 
horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data 
integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you 
have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on 
it's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I 
don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S 
internal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it's 'newer'.

You are setting doit to false in the callback, and Text[Field] is beeping

	It was for the purpose of establishing a state, not an
exclusive state.  If the state was to be exclusive, it would not have
400 000 arab citizens.

	And no, I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile
action.  When someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing
to sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  It
is not a hostile action leading to war.

	Oh, you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens?  The
arabs who stayed are now citizens, with as much right to choose who
they vote for as the Jews.

	Huh?  The people who left, did so voluntarily.  There is no

	Israel got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It
still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how
is granting citizenship a facade?

	Try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to
establish what it is.

	Also, Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand
years.  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel.
There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500.
Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.  Does that
make the land Jewish?

The Wall Street Journal had an article on how the police were whining
about all the new guns; excuse me, but police are EMPLOYEES of the
government. Rather like having your janitor complain about job
conditions.

I say Californians should form armed block clubs that would engage
in coordinated strategies should BATF attempt to disarm them based
on the ""nefarious tipster"" theory of law enforcement. Unlike Waco, 
Californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city
streets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them down
with abandoned car blockades. M-1 Garands should easily outclass
BATF shock troops with their H&K MP-5 SMGs, and there should be
enough Sony Walkmans and Boom Boxes to overwhelm any FBI psy-war
operation... yes, a good time would be had by all. Billary Clinton
would get what he wanted, a War on Gunowners, the BATF would attempt
to show the anti-gun press they they really, REALLY were in charge
with a 500-man ""Charge of the Light Brigade,"" and the FBI would attempt 
to show how _THEY_ really were in charge by asking the Californian 
National Guard to level the area with artillary!

There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad.
I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured
them for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not
called to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexuals
treated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach 
Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should
also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because
the witches in the middle ages were persecuted.

And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see
if I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians
to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge
to look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should-
I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know
very many homosexuals as it is.  

But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love
were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to 
homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to 
stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous 
thing.

That is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able
to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of
the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality
as normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe
that homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence
against them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there
is also the problem of what has been called ""unsanctified mercy.""
Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in 
this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in 
the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have 
embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the
conservative churches to justify their actions.  

>Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people

Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus.
But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't
go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects
to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told
another not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times.
We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them
to begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to the
gospel.

Does anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency? My younger brothers

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I
came up with:
ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M
This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.
Quick summary of each commmand:
Z0	- Reset modem to User Profile 0.
L2	- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
N2	- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
X5	- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)
&D0	- Assume DTR (computer) is always on
S11=50	- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)

In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 right
before the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer 
function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra
14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.

In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changed
the 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, and
everything seems to work fine.

Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.  If someone wants to forward
this to the /info-mac/reports directory at sumex-aim, it might save other
newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings, and
also save the net some redundant messages.  If anyone else has something
to add, feel free.

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of
the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,
the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.

Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing
us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It
is not ""produced"": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for
example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an
earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.

: arrange their affairs.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their
Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, ""hi'ipoi"", the Hawaiian
word for ""cherish"" means ""sharing food"".  The Great Mahele, in which
the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called ""theft"" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,
until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

These are the people we call ""savages"".

On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would
behoove you to study *all* of the facts.

Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to
run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office.

Many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended
PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on
my Sparc and PC with only one hitch. 
The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. 
On the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows
installation.


The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory
had the line
DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY

s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console.
By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned
and the clients connected to the server at

`hostname`:1.0

Some comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru
a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line.
My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra, 16 MB

Bitmap Stuff Sucked.
Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable.
Xmail was very usable.

At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was
a very noticable delay, I put this down to brain damaged ""WINDOWS
should not be called a SCHEDULER"", besides that this will become
my remote work environment for a while.

Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product, the sales
person said they performed about the same, given the over head of
WINDOWS I question this?

many thanks for help to all who responded

For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion.    There
does  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem.  My current
episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea.  If  it's
bad  enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy.  However, my doctor
this time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  to

  I am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration.
It's going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus
network.  (Actually, it already is running, it's just not getting all
the info I want it to yet...)  Anyway, I want to check for a mouse.  I
already check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft's Mouse
book).  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
program runs, or that they ever load the driver.

  Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, how
do I detect is a mouse is attached?  I know it can be done because the
mouse driver can do it.

  Thanks in advance,

************************************************************

The Event:

* The Joliet Mud Turtles, a Chicago land four wheel drive club, is
  sponsoring an On/Off Road Rally Sunday April 25th.

* For those who ask ""What is an on/off road rally?"", well...

  An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:

   1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of
      directions and clues guiding participates around the 
      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course
      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will
      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the
      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately 
      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is 
      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points
      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions
      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,
      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.

   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants
      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.
      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles
      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half
      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle
      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will
      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified
      4x4s can run the course.
     
  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring
  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.
  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.

* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles
  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be
  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section
  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper
  from their vehicle :) .

The Particulars:

* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.
    (815)436-9382   (see map below)
* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.
* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine
* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.
* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)
* A valid drivers license is required
* Suggested equipment:
      CB Radio
      Compass
      Tow Strap and Clevis
      Clip Board and Pencil
* No alcohol during rally

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that
something similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently
don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing
cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests
are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the
video being piped into a command center they're building
somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or
cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large
multi-colored status displays will show the various routes
using different colors to represent the various average speeds
for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front
of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic
status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also
looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to
providing continuous audio from this system.

In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display
boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data
on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the
system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it
will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is
similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read
""cheap"").

We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP
audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal
reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle
receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is
applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some
other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your
stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station
jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.
I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle
receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly
fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers
don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely
true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system
up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You
may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing
more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)

I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more
info on how the LA system is networked and paid for.

Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X
Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price
titled ""Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco"".

The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort.
Without doing a complete review of the paper, I'll just mention the goals
as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing
the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib.
Features they want in FRESCO include:

lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs
Structured Graphics
Resolution independence
Natural C++ programming interface
edit-in-place embedding
distributed user interface components
Multithreading

This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions
sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in
early 93, with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample
implementation.

I am not affiliated with any of the people or places mentioned above.

But the impressive performance of the Graphite was

Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does
the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference
just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,
it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're
probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware
cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible
that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just 
that.

In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless
of what the server returns.

Well, that's the question, isn't it?  The goals are probably not all that
obvious.  We can set up a few goals, like happiness and liberty and
the golden rule, etc.  But these goals aren't inherent.  They have to
be defined before an objective system is possible.

It is not too difficult, one you have goals in mind, and absolute
knoweldge of everyone's intent, etc.

Omniscience is fine, as long as information is not given away.  Isn't
this the resolution of the free will problem?  An interactive omniscient
being changes the situation.

Well, I was speaking about an objective system in general.  I didn't
mention a specific goal, which would be necessary to determine the
morality of an action.

There were some significant differences.  Whereas the Branch Davidians are
reported to have gotten along rather well with their neighbors, the MOVE
people are generally conceded to have gone far out of the way to antagonize
their BLACK neighbors, using loudspeakers to all hours of the night, keeping
large piles of garbage, promoting rat and insect infestation, and allegedly
threatening to kidnap their neighbors' children.

Still the same sort of questions regarding use of force remain in that case.

I don't understand the fascination with vent windows. They create a tremendous 
turbulence and noise that makes even a simple connversation impossible at 
speeds above 40mph. The current flow-throuh ventilation, if designed right, 
are far more superior.

Don't have a list of what's been said before, so hopefully not repeating.

How about horizontally mounted oil filters (like on my Ford) that, no
matter how hard you try, will spill out their half quart on the bottom
of the car when you change them?

There are several public domain utilities available at your usual
archive site that allow 'extraction' of single frames from a .gl
file, check in the 'graphics' directories under *grasp.  The problem 
is that the .clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of 
the many pd format converters I have used. Any hint welcome!
Let me know if you have problems locating the utilities.

  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)
when stored on a concrete floor?  
  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and I just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but 
they act like the two terminals are shorted.  I asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that, 'cause it ruins them,
but he couldn't tell me why.

	Math CoProcessor option

My purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent
me the Apple summary documentation to prove it.  I ordered the coprocessor
option, but I'm really not sure that we needed it.  I thought the '040 chip
had a math coprocessor built into it.  Has Apple had a math coprocessor chip

I am concerned that I may have set up a hardware bottleneck.  Please send your

I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the
Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East.  It was also his career high
48th. 

Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the
1986 ALCS.  The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox *1* strike away from
the pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run.
That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen in
baseball.  The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the same
thing done to them in the WS against the Mets.  Speaking of the METS,
isn't it strange how the NLCS that year with the Astros ALMOST
mirrored the 1980 NLCS with the Phillies??  The Astros have been
painfully close twice I must admit.

A practical suggestion, to be sure, but one could *also* peek into

Mar 93."" Another posting called ""USENET READERSHIP SUMMARY REPORT FOR

Reid, alas, gives us no measure of the ""power/influence"" of readers...

Subject: Some questions from a new Christian
Organization: University of Delaware
Lines: 40

Hi,

I am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. I was
raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an
agnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the
Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am
happy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and
quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying
to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful
to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other
relevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would
like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological
works intended for a lay person?

I have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated
with any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria
should one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the difference
between the various Protestant denominations.

Thanks for reading my post. 

Sincerely,

Steve Hoskins

[Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an
introduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible
courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary
styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further
reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT
introduction.  There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  They
often have background articles that are helpful.  Probably the best
recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  (I
think there may be a couple of books with this title.  This is a
fairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with the
Society for Biblical Criticism.)  If you are committed to inerrancy,
you will probably prefer something more conservative.  I don't read a
lot of conservative books, but a commentary I looked at by Donald
Guthrie looked rather good.  He has a NT Introduction, and he's also
editor of Eerdman's Bible Commentary.  --clh]

Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business
or professional body in a position to establish a standard and
provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission
systems.

RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of
a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.

Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they
all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.

If we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to
put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a
crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to
implement it, we might avoid government control.

Otherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably
strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They
are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through
the Clipper Chip.

Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one,
would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.

If not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented
in either SW or HW and publish it, then push to make it the defacto
standard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming such.

We are opposing, charging the bunker.  We should be nimble and clever.

Subject: Too Many Europeans in NHL
Organization: Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada
Lines: 50



   Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:

Canadians: 400
Americans: 100
Europeans: 100

   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.

   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the
Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and
""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,
and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well. 

    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, the
Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a
Canucks fan to begin with ;-). 

    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and
some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even
better hockey players. It's all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening,
but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.

    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly
only getting worse.

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.

    I just don't want them on mine.

If you recall, a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon

But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways?
If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word
of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the
Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall,
Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas
it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.

That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups

True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate
in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas
were attacking Israeli lines.

The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term
peace as others in the area might be.

I tried to install a foreign language Windows application

WIndows 3.1 installation disks for this file, but could not
find it.  Does anybody have any idea what this file is for and
where one could get it from?

Request for Information

I have been reading about an organisation called ""WinWord Developer's Relations
Group"".  I believe they have produced publications called WinWord Software
Development Kit (or WordBasic SDK) and 'The Proceedings of the Windows
Developers' Tools Conference, WordBasic' sessions assembled by Steve Wexler.

Would you be able to help me with a contact name and address for this
organisation or these publications.

Thank you

I bought a car with a defunct engine, to use for parts
for my old but still running version of the same car.

The car I bought has good tires.

Is there anything in particular that I should do to
store the defunct car long-term?  I'd hate to have
parts of it go bad.  Someone has told me it's bad
for the tires to not move the car once-in-a-while.
Is this true?   Do I need some props to take the
weight of the tires?

Best to reply by mail, I am getting spotty news delivery.

This is the new Buffalo one, the second since he's been with the
Sabres?  I recall a price tag of over $700 just for the paint job on
that mask, and a total price of almost $1500.  Ouch.

    The story goes like this:

       Spanky is too slow!  If he were quicker, he would still be here.
But with Slaught and Tom Prince, they didn't want to lose Prince in order

I also use Retrospect, but I noticed that Central Point Software's
""MacTools Backup"" also supports the Apple tape drive under 7.x. 
The Apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of Retrospect
relative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than 
might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive.  

Used Apple tape drives are going for ~$100, so it might make less
economic sense to pay an extra ~$140 for Retrospect when MacTools 
is cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities.

Retrospect is nice, though, and I'm probably going to upgrade to 2.0.

 ========================================================================
A couple of points on this thread.

1. We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger
   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.

2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is
   not dependent on ""sophisticated tools""  (CASE tools?).  However, tools
   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle
   Language) is somewhat limited.

3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated ""Level 5"" by a NASA team.
   This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.

4. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info
   on our software development process.

In Holland insurences pay for Homeopathic treatment. In Germany they do
so as well. I Austria they do if you have a condition which can not be 
helped by ""normal"" medicine (happened to me). Switzerland seems to be 
the same as Austria (I have direct experience in the Swiss case).

At the Univeristy of Vienna (I believe Innsbruck as well) homeopathy
can be taken in Med. school.

I found that in combination with Acupuncture it changed my life from
living hell to a condition which enables me to lead a relatively 
normal life. I found that modern medicine was powerless to cure me
of a *severe* case of Neurodermitis (Note: I mean cure, not 
surpress the symptoms, which is what modern medicine attempts to 
do in the case of Neurodermitis). 

I'm not saying that Homeopathy is scientific, but that it can offer 
help in areas in which modern medicine is absolutely helpless.

From reading your aritcle it seems that your have some deeply rooted
beliefs about this issue (this is not intended to be offensive or

This has me thinking.  Is there a biological reason why women can't put
their keys in their pants pockets like men do?  I have two pockets on the
back of each of my pants.  I put my keys in one and wallent in another.
Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely.
Everything is that much simpler for me.  Why can't women do the same?
Is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents?

Question:
If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/-
by 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally
valuable as a player who plays in all of them.

Since the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how 
""transferable"" between teams that these stats are.  Shouldn't the average
standard deviation in the league be used?

I am interested in seeing each method.
But I still think that mine is the best. If for no other reason than familiarity.

     Here is my traditional experience with tickets, playoffs and otherwise,
at the Civic Arena.

     Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best 
strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.
Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,
when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell
and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.

     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; 
what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).

Others can add on their opinions as well.

OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,
is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar.

Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its
own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to
get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches
to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to
remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,
through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along 
a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change 
surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact 
patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It 
probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, 
but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a 
better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch
forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.
You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
was the rotation that did it.

Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.
Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them
about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.
How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking
for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski
or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged
like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.
I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like
that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.
Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try
one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.
So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,
a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have
countersteering.

Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have
motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what
real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations
of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm 
willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. 

If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's
behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.

    To display Millions of colors on a 16"" monitor you need 2MB of VRAM
in the Q950.

    Correct. This is the amount of on-board VRAM that the Q800 comes
with.

    Yes this is possible. Technically, you only need to take out 2 of
the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything
because the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM. It only
knows 1MB and 2MB.

>From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
>16-bit color, is that correct?

    Yes, this is correct. You get to 1MB by putting 2 256k VRAM SIMMs
into the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q800's motherboard.

    Yup. You have to take off the power supply. It's only a couple of
screws so you should be ok. Just make sure that everything is
disconnected from it and watch out for static discharges.

They certainly are until the Arabs make peace.  Only the most leftist/Arabist

ABOUT THIS POSTING
------------------
This is a listing of likely questions and information about RIPEM, a
program for public key mail encryption.  It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was
written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen
<mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of
newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM
is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.

WHAT'S NEW
----------
I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It
does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but
it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and
some other stuff.  The URL is ""http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html"".

This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information
on patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to
have a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again
soon. :-)

DISCLAIMER
----------
Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything
other than one layperson's opinion.  If you want real legal advice,
talk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law,
export regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
---------------------

1)  What is RIPEM?

 RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy
 Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the
 four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection
 (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and
 non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: ""What is PEM?"")

 RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.
 Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,
 which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.

 The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the
 Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.

2)  How can I get RIPEM?

 RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is
 considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution
 to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or
 Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained
 (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were
 shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something
 weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may
 change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the
 README file that this law not be violated:

 #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution
 #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,
 #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.

 Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is
 included with the distribution.  You should read it before using
 RIPEM.

 RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent
 residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README
 file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a
 product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping
 distribute it.

 RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on
 ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the
 U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out
 how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file
 GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are
 available here in addition to the full source tree.

3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?

 Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of
 Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to
 Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice
 Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports
 are expected, and help of users is invited.

4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?

 Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend
 on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users
 guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM
 with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.
 Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU
 Emacs.

 If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one
 in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,
 and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.

5)  What is RSA?

 RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means
 that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to
 decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,
 you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your
 decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public
 key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to
 decrypt it.  Note that the ""message"" sent with RSA is normally just
 the DES key to the real plaintext. (See ""What is DES?"")

 Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For
 originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of
 origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message
 (See ""What is a fingerprint, like MD5?"") is encrypted with the
 sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving
 authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm
 that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.

 RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who
 invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography
 in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information
 also may be in sci.crypt.

6)  What is DES?

 DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or
 secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to
 encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.

 RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts
 your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the
 recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,
 allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.

 DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a
 key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it
 should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large
 corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM
 standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the
 near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be
 stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with
 interoperability.

7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?

 MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.
 It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,
 of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not
 possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a
 different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,
 instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,
 only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.

 MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,
 RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so
 parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate
 channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.

 MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often
 used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a
 passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.

 MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in
 RFC 1321.

 There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong
 a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash
 function will be used if this is accepted as true.

8)  What is PEM?

 PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of
 encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a
 working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these
 documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.

 RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM
 specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not
 handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.

9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?

 For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know
 your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message
 received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important
 that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that
 his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.

 RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,
 the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are
 described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.
 None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for
 key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM
 is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.

10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?

 This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,
 the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section
 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be
 met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421
 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key
 cryptography.

 This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that
 everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of
 patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key
 cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive
 (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter
 and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are
 compressed with a patented algorithm.)

11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?

 RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company
 specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a
 firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.
 patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:

      Cryptographic Apparatus and Method
      (""Diffie-Hellman"")............................... No. 4,200,770

      Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method (""Hellman-Merkle"").................... No. 4,218,582

      Cryptographic Communications System and
      Method (""RSA"")................................... No. 4,405,829

      Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus
      and Method (""Hellman-Pohlig"").................... No. 4,424,414

 PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key
 cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for
 example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)
 PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of
 companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their
 products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their
 patents.

 RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than
 its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its
 author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.
 However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got
 interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some
 people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing
 code.  RIPEM even won the ""Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992""
 award.

12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?

 RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography
 Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the
 key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as
 those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys
 are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were
 generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.

13)  What is PGP?

 PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.
 PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.
 PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.

 A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:

 - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without
   a direct network connection.

 - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability
   of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be
   compatible with anything other than itself.

 - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which
   comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own
   implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its
   patents to ""make, use or sell"" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without
   either a license or written permission.  (See: ""DISCLAIMER"")
   (See: ""What about RSADSI/PKP?"")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of
   PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal
   action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but
   it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening
   in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:

   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, 
   #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public
   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is
   #contraband.

 - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside
   the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP
   already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.

 Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is
 recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.
 Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,
 which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to
 liability concerns.

14)  What about RPEM?

 RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,
 but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in
 an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was
 written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.

 Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many
 (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough
 to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally
 accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.

 RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.

15)  What is MIME?

 MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is
 described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup
 comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with
 MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution
 of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM
 messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft
 Internet documents exist on the matter.

16)  What is TIS/PEM?

 Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy
 Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was
 rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)
 rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know
 much more than that.

17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...

 You may wish to check the companion post ""ripem-attacks"" which
 discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and
 what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main ""weak area"" is
 probably key distribution.

I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs. But did the Hurt
study make any distinction between an *ability* to swerve and a *failure*
to swerve? In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen, riders
will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare, simply because
the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rides
everything else. Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive
manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable?

I agree.  So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?

Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy 
a bunch of their stuff :).

One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.
This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to 
deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you 
look at it :).

Great!  Where can I buy it?

Another note: If ""Clipper"" increases the incentive to bring stronger 
encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at 
the moment.

You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a 
restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making 
cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.

Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone 
*IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute 
for the ""voice scramblers"" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.

I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no
  amp which can touch it at the price range.
The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other 
  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid
  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.
If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components 
  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect
  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each
  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are
  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.

I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east
  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant.
I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with
  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.

My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like
  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded
  like new.

If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will
  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.

Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.

You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people 
have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.

And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you 
can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the 
FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.

I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense.
You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this 
compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless 
to me.

I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't 
stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me 
sad and sick.

Have you ever heard of Jonestown?
The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority 
worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these 
people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot 
more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as 
last year.

Well, if they were Satanists, or followers of an obscure religion,
then I would be sure that Christians would in unison condemn and 
make this to a show case. But when we are dealing with a fanatical
Revelation preacher that kills ultimately everyone, including the
innocent children, then it seems that we are dealing with Christians 
and christians (note the spelling).

Fascinating.  Most of the content of the White House announcements was
in what was *not* said.  It gives us almost nothing of value, threatens to
take away a lot, and does it with a sincere smile on its face,
and the nice friendly word ""Management"".

			      FACT SHEET
		     PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The first thing it doesn't say is ""We're giving you stronger encryption"".
what it says is 
   the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only
   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust
   than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of
   the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the
   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to
   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.
But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,
so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!
*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they
need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search
for the other 40-bit key.

Similarly, it didn't say ""We're making encryption is commercially available.""
because encryption *is* already commercially available, including
forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.
And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were
convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.

The next thing it didn't say is ""We're making encryption legal"",
because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the
President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree.
What it *did* say was:
	In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the
	private sector from developing, or the government from approving,
	other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in
	assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.
which clearly means ""We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.
Soon.  Once business buys into this.""

Another thing it didn't say is ""We're going to ask Congress for money
to do *lots* more wiretapping"", because of course, there's a budget crisis,
and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.
What it *did* say was:
   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
   the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
   law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General
   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.
which means ""We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to
buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO
(that's what ""preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance"" 
means.)

INteresting question about Galileo.

Galileo's HGA  is stuck.   

The HGA was left closed,  because galileo  had a venus flyby.

If the HGA were pointed att he sun,  near venus,  it would
cook the foci elements.

question:  WHy couldn't Galileo's  course manuevers have been
designed such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point.?

After all,  it would normally be aimed at earth anyway?

or would it be that an emergency situation i.e. spacecraft safing

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without
doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been
known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting
smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the
person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the
interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per
day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still
rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned
about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and
even a small increase in risk is significant there.

This example is probably wrong.  There is the case of one famous

Hi! Everyone,

Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from
4 points, I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse
from its offset. For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find
the original ellipse analytically?

I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,
but I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinear
programming technique to deal with this problem approximately.

Any ideas will be greatly appreciated. Please post here, let the others

By rotating the plate around the mouse ball counter-clockwise you can open

it opens quite easily once you see what has to be done.

The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station, but doesn't come close to
the ULTIMATE in Sports Radio, 610 WIP in Philadelphia.  The signal
might not be as powerful, but then again only stations in New York
feel ""obligated"" to pollute everyone else's airwaves with a bunch of
hoodlum Mets fans complaining 24 hours a day.  WIP took two of your
best sports jockeys too, Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks.  610
WIP is rockin with sports talk from 5:30 AM till midnight, check it
out anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia.  If I'm not
mistaken, WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation?

p.s the only nice thing about the FAN is that they talk sports all
night.  hopefully 610 will begin to do that somewhat soon

Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies.  While I'm not real sure of
his credibility, I do remember a book he wrote, called A VISION or
something like that.  He made a prediction that people who bought gold
would be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800;
now it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mind
because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.

The problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and
forget ones that didn't (a la Jean Dixon).  Does anyone know if there
any of his predictions, perhaps from the book I mentioned, that can
pretty definitely be said to have not come true?

Subject: Re: mouse on COM3 under Windows 3.1 ?
Organization: UMass-Lowell Computer Science
Lines: 8

I've pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because I have the same requirements you do......and the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers don't accept mice at any but com1 and com2 using irq4 or irq3 unless you buy special drivers from someone who has them.....I've talked to Mouse Systems who say their driver doesn't support other than com1 and com2 as above , but who claim to be releasing one that will SOON!??.

The other alternative seems to be possible, but in one case prohibitively expensive, i.e. 4 port card for $600??????!!, and in the other, the author(s) of PowerBBS for Windows claim to have a 4 port serial card with buffered 16550 UARTS and drivers for windows to match (i.e. com3 irq5) for $120......

The second paragraph is hearsay, because I haven't checked it out yet.....but intend to as soon as I can free up $120 <g>

Hope this will save you some steps.

    Of course, nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash
and installing it yourself. Even modifying the core to match some
arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. I once knew someone who
had fixed his locks in this way - his house, office and cars all took
the same key (which he took GOOD care of :-)

>Bad analogy.

    Very bad (yours, that is). Have you ever had a safety deposit box?
They work on a two-key system. The bank clerk has one, and you have
the other (they are different keys). The bank does NOT keep a copy of
your key. If you lose it, they have to drill out the lock, and replace
the door. This is a time consuming and expensive process (which they
will be happy to charge to your account :-).

     This process is exactly analogous to having a private key which
is NOT in a escrow system, and the state having to crack your cipher
to get the data.

     Please do not use false analogies.

Hear, hear!  Thanks, Robbie.

You also don't read that much about violence *against* teenagers, such as
George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi 17-year-olds,
who were trying to surrender, with bulldozers.


On the other hand, I think it *is* true, without singling out teenagers
for blame, that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be.
Those of us who'd like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do
with people of all ages.

There is no contradiction here. It is essential in the sense that your
body needs it. It is non-essential in the sense that your body can
produce enough of it without supplement.

	Ironically, Bush could have frozen spending, kept his ""no new taxes""
pledge and balanced the budget.

 Note that this information is culled from press releases and posts.  It 
is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or 
of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two 
postings.
 
 Boston Bruins
  Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden 
finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project 
back on track to be finished in September 1995.
  Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following 
surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back.
**
  Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.

 Buffalo Sabres
1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)
  Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike 
Ramsey.
**
  Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the 
club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion 
Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television 
and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season.
**
  Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of 
American Hockey League.

 Calgary Flames
  Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future 
considerations.
**
  Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt 
Lake City of International Hockey League.

 Chicago Blackhawks
        The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to 
open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's 
Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two 
teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the 
old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility, 
located directly across the street, opens.
  Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report 
following a trade with Edmonton.

 Detroit Red Wings
  Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft 
pick.
  Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in 
the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft.
**
  Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall 
of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze 
plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site 
of the Michigan Hall of Fame.

 Edmonton Oilers
  Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug 
Weight.
  Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.
  NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with 
Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the 
city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to 
administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner 
Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has 
threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no 
money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat 
Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce 
significant revenues for other owners.
  Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the 
remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.

 Hartford Whalers
  Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.
  Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from 
Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick.

Whalers franchise in the city.

might play, because of a broken collarbone.

draft picks in 1993.
  Added defenseman Travis Richards from the University of Minnesota.
  A former employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Minnesota North 
Star owner Norman Green. Karen (Kari) Dziedzic, Green's former executive 
assistant, claims Green often instructed her to wear cosmetics, described 
her outfits as ""very hot"" and ""very sexy,"" once slapped her hand as she 
was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it 
through a client's hair.
  The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season, 
announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for 
their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800.
  The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it 
wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last 
home game.  The club is moving to Dallas for next season.  The club must 
pay unpaid interest of $4,492.80 on the team's late rent payment for 1992, 
which was made earlier this month, and has been instructed not to take 
property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine.
**
  Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, 
allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two 
regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the 
end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league didn't 
rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The Stars 
recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo, 
Mich., to replace Churla.

 Montreal Canadiens
  Acquired defenseman Rob Ramage from Tampa Bay for minor league 
defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.

 New Jersey Devils
**
  Bernie Nicholls publicly apologized for his criticism of referee Denis 
Morel after the Devils' 5-2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres.  Nicholls was 
ejected by Morel for being the third man in on a fight late in the second 
period of that game and afterward Nicholls called Morel ""a homer"" and ""an 
embarrassment to the referee's association.""

 New York Islanders
  Traded right wing Daniel Marois to Boston for a conditional draft 
choice.

 New York Rangers
  Obtained forward Esa Tikkanen from Edmonton for center Doug Weight.
  Acquired left winger Mike Hartman from Tampa Bay

over San Jose. The team said he slipped on an icy patch of pavement as he 
was getting out of a taxi cab in front of his apartment.
**

herniated disc in his back and will not play again this season.
**

season, one year behind schedule.
  The Ottawa Senators lost their 37th consecutive NHL road game to tie the

third-round 1993 draft choice.
**
  Revolutionary Comics of San Diego agreed to destroy all available copies

over a trademark infringement lawsuit.  The Penguins sued in February 
charging that the ""Sport Stars Mario Lemieux"" comic infringed on the 
team's logo and uniform, which are registered trademarks.

Hockey League.

 Tampa Bay Lightning
1-800-881-2639
        At least two investor groups are poised to build a sports arena in 
downtown Tampa if the delay-plagued company that holds a lease from the 
Tampa Bay Lightning bows out. Tampa Coliseum Inc. has a lease with the 
National Hockey League team to develop an entertainment and sports arena 
next to Tampa Stadium, but has been unable to raise enough money for the 
project.

draft choice.
  Sent defenseman Rob Ramage to the Montreal Canadiens for minor league 
defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.
**
  Manon Rheaume's first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta 
Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be 
a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume, the 
first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six 
goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After 
the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to 
compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East 
Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor 
league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.
**
  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that 
the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the 
Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning 
general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that 
the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are 
exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But 
Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  ""We were disappointed 
with ESPN's irresponsible comment,"" Esposito said.  ""There is just no 
substance to the rumor."" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years 
regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to 
build a new arena.

**

championship, gave up his final year of eligibility and signed a contract 
with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

 Vancouver Canucks
       The Vancouver Canucks have cleared the last hurdle in their effort 
to build a new stadium. Vancouver council has given the green light for 
the 100 million dollar complex. It will seat 20 thousand people and will

B.C. Place in Vancouver. Site preparation will begin this summer, with a 
completion date of Fall 1995.

assist in a 5-4 loss to Toronto.
**

meeting the No. 8 team in the first round, No. 2 vs. No. 7, No. 3 vs. No. 
6 and No. 4 vs. No. 5. Matchups will be based on overall points with the 
four division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds 
in each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff 
rounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except 
matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3-
2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season 
points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.

- Draft news:

        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in 
June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one 
goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion 
drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction 
between forwards and defensemen.
        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down 
from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and 
Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.
        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of 
one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is 
that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.
        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises 
will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total 
of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa 
Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two 
new teams.
        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority 
drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst 
records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The 
expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, 
Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.
        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry 
Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new 
teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 
1994.

        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 
1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a 
delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.

official medal events at the Games.  The decision, which came at the 
organizing committee meeting here, followed an accord reached in Nagano 
between the committee and the IOC Coordination Committee.  The decision 
will be formally ratified by an Executive Board meeting of the 
International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its Session.  As a result, the 
number of total events at Nagano will increase to 64 in seven sports.

        The site for the 75th Memorial Cup Tournament has yet to be 
chosen.  It will be staged in Ontario but the exact location won't be 
determined until next spring.
        In March of '93, the two regular-season division champions from 
the Ontario Hockey League will meet in a best-of-seven series at the start 
of the playoff season.  The winner of the series earns the right to host 
the Memorial Cup, traditionally held in May.
        The eventual OHL champion will also participate in the tourney. 
But if the league champs also happen to be the club hosting the Memorial 
Cup, then the league finalists will advance as well.""

  Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early 
November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local 
interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000 
salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players 
are not limited to three years in the league.
  A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93-
94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron 
confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under 
consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking 
games with the Eastern Division.  Meanwhile, San Antonio and Houston are 
close to being confirmed as the league's newest members.

 - Major League Hockey
 
        A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States 
and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993, officials announced 
Wednesday, February 10.
        Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of 
the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New 
Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.
        According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams 
playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have 
been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, 
Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto 
and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.
        Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its 
rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''
        Boe said league play will have an international flair and 
discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the 
IIHF.
        ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and 
eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.
        The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.

 8. Answers to some frequently asked questions:
 
 Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?
 A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in 
and around Montreal. Hence they were called ""Les Habitants"" (natives of 
Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.
 
 Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?
 A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to 
signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer 
existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.

 Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?
 A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is 
a weekly journal with up-to-date info.
Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)
Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)
 
 Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in 
the NHL?
 A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 
chances.
 
 Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?
 A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when 
a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a 
+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-
handed goals do count for +/-.
 
 Q: What is the five-hole?
 A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: 
(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower 
right, and (5) five-hole.
 
 Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?
 A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven 
series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a 
game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.

 Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?
 A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever 
to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for 
the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis 
Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat 
Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine 
shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately 
lost the game, 6-4.

 Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?
 A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed 
the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be 
worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 
million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.

 Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?
 A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National 
Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey 
League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as 
assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in 
September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell 
University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.

 Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?
 A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and 
Colonial Hockey Leagues.

	I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space
limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to
those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at
what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the
endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility
of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and
draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental
flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing
the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.
Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault
rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has
only range and acurracy going for it.

	I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much
more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word
would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this
is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change
quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians
intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The
balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.

	That seems to be the case already, given that heavy
weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low
numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior
weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically
superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training
includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,
whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.

	I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers
of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the
heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman
tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders
from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,
though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should
therefore be jointly maintained and operated.

	This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control
over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state
to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that
the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,
I would have to assume that State control would rest on the
authority of the Governor and militia officers.

	I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,
fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few
people with government support.  Just as you argued above that
the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control
so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this
situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding
all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.
I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that
the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the
unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.

	We have to assume that there would be those who would
side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all
the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.
I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the
local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their
armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the
tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.
I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.

>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds

>I would much rather see these things handled by the local,

	So would I, but the resources often aren't available to
outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to
call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster
than anything else.

>Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of
>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to 
>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry
>arm of the regular army.

	Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think
main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up
field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton
trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff
of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units
in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.

	Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy
equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light
stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the
states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local
ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,
hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,
the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for
other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a
very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias
for these functions.

Subject: Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts.
Organization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo
Lines: 51

Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For
example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a ""safe""
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  

For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments
""turned off"" rather than just ""safed"".  Was it political (i.e.
as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging
congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky
scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  

I've heard the argument that an active but ""uncontrolled""
spacecraft causes ""radio noise.""  I find that hard to believe
that this could be a problem in a properly designed ""safe"" mode.
This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the
spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a
(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.
At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can
continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to
the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the
spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be
prepared if necessary.  

As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is
beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,
great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.
By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps
someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the
data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.

I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which
could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to
places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,
exiting the solar system, etc).   

Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,
etc) should consider designing in a ""pause"" mode in case their
spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of
the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could
have some kind of routine written in for the post mission
""drift"" phase.

So any holes in all this?

I know that there is MSG sensitivity.  When I eat foods with MSG I get
very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I first
experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese
food almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I can
notice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completely.

Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing
the exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because I
don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still
love it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where
one of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavor
packets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised at
places you find MSG.

The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so
greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some
claim their heart ""skipped"" beats once in a while. Some reacted with
headache, some stomach ache. Some had watery eyes or running nose, some
had itchy skin or rashes. More serious accusations include respiration 
difficulty and brain damage. 

Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food poisoning. But
if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.

I had this problem when I first loaded windows.  My I/O card is for 2 HD's
2 FD's 1 Parrelel 2 serial (1 for mouse and 1 for my external modem) and
a game port.  PROBLEM enters.  The DARN serial ports have no selection for 
COM settings, they are stuck on 3 and 4.  
Good card for HD's and FD's but lousy for serial. 

I called Microsoft and other places.  The long and short of it is
WINDOWS wants com1 and 2 ONLY!, for mouse selection.
I went out and bought a small I/O card just for parrelel and serial.
Now I have ALL 4 active COM ports and LPT1 and LPT2.
This Half card was less than $20.

Mouse on COM 1  external modem on COM 2,  I disabled the LPT2 so I could use
the interupt for my scanner card IRQ.

Aaahh... a problem very near and dear to my heart. In our case, other
monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be
specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this
problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc
several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the
juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side
of wall maybe?
We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input
lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference
effect on the computer monitor next to it. 
Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very
common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type
O'scopes).
I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount
around deflection coil of interfering monitor. 
BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH
VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T
BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO
MOUNT CAN.
Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also
good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on
monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other
sources.

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would
have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous
years (which I didn't have access to).

The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good
as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.

>I don't know.  You tell me.  What percentage of players reach or

The MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a ""this is how
well he hit *last* year, in major league terms"" rating.  So, in essence, he
has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half
of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe
more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.

Did they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place
and last place, but no more.

Sure; they didn't have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted the
farm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really
in contention.

If you'd read what I wrote, you'd be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put
any credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn't
done anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training
could interpret as ""failure"".  Just because I think spring training numbers
are meaningless doesn't mean that Bobby Cox does; it's just a case of ruling
out one possible explanation for sending Lopez down.

Keith Mitchell did very very well at AA, AAA, and the majors over a season,
then did very, very poorly for a year in AAA.

Actually, my interest in gender issues is not limited to international
boundaries.  Indeed, I often exchange information with Americans about
issues which concern us, in both countries.

Yes, thank you, though I am really curious as to why this never came out
(at least not in what I saw, up here in Canada, or on CNN, which is sent
up here) during the Thomas nomination hearings.  Surely, one would think
that her claim to having been sexually harassed, would have a great deal
less credibility if it could be shown that she had herself been guilty of it.

Ahemmm....  It depends.  :-)

(For instance, if it were the ""sworn statements"" at the Warren Commission,
then yes, I _would_ say that the statements were no better than toilet
paper, used at that :-), but in most cases, the answer would be ""no"").

  _______________________________________________________________
  
  For Immediate Release	   	     	           April 14, 1993
  
  
                 TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
                        TO THE SPEAKER OF THE
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
               THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE
  
  
                           April 13, 1993
  
  
  Dear Mr. Speaker:      (Dear Mr. President:)
  
  As part of my continuing effort to keep the Congress fully 
  informed, I am providing this report, consistent with section 4 
  of the War Powers Resolution, to advise you of actions that I 
  have ordered in support of the United Nations efforts in 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina.
  
  Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of 
  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively 
  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security 
  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all 
  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There 
  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages 
  in Bosnia have been bombed.
  
  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, 
  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all 
  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize 
  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-
  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  
  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air 
  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General 
  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY 
  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating 
  allies.
  
  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my 
  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to 
  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct 
  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by 
  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces 
  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and 
  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  
  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. 
  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for 
  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.
  
  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air 
  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early 
  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally 
  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the 
  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching 
  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, 
  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these 
  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such 
  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by 
  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved

  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will 
  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations 
  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was 
  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully 
  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.
  
  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such 
  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces 
  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional 
  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-
  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and 
  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward 
  toward attainment of our goals in this region.

I have to agree with you... the police may have carried it a bit too far
but Rodney King was no angel either. And I don't think ANY guilty
verdicts should have been returned. I'm sure you know why they handed
down guilty verdicts on two of the officers. It's quite simple really,
it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities
think it's right to riot. I hate to say this, but I would have liked to
see them riot with everyone prepared. It would be open season if your
skin was even slightly brown.

Hey, my motto is, you don't fuck with me or my stuff and you don't get
killed. It's just that simple.

If you are porting InterViews over to MS Windows, I thought InterViews was

I am in complete concordance with you there, Mike.  I was a Silver StarRider

countersteering when being taught to instruct.  It doesn't seem to have

Maybe because the claims deserve refute?  The above abstract lists various
possible links to cannabis use (unfiltered almost guaranteed) and lung
problems.  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article, but 
without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered 
their data it really doesn't tell you shit.  I'm going to track down that
study hopefully tomarrow.

What justifies _the_ truth about drugs?  Research?  What sort of

prove anything.

Heroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administration
and shit like adulterants.  There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they
effect people differently.

Stereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that 
function just fine in society.

NO, NO, NO.  (or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough
data to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis
is benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they
are only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others,
and that makes them stronger.

In general, I somewhat see what you're saying.  And people like Jack Herer

To maintain my senses at their sharpest, I never eat a full meal
within 24 hrs of a ride.   I've tried Slim Fast Lite before a 
ride but found that my lap times around the Parliament Buildings suffered 
0.1 secs.   The resultant 70 pound weight loss over the summer
just sharpens my bike's handling and I can always look

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.

The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced,
translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this
does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying
their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But
it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that
the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own
diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.

Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning
that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for
him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone
else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is
not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages
a court would award.

However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,
almost certainly it is ""obvious to one skilled in the art"" and therefore
unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)
cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.

Caution:  I am not a lawyer.  Consulting a professional would be wise if
significant amounts of money are at stake.

All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point
pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or
Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really
sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by
the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of
the Chruch to do so.

Andy Byler

[You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church
establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is
that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the
ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based
on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'
teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship
occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these
points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more
time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are
right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.

Accepting the principle of ""sola scriptura"" does not commit us to
obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite
clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is
on where the Bible would have us place the line.

By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters
that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to
determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that
the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship
falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or
(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to
decide.

Where in the Bible is there *any* teaching about an immaterial afterlife?
I was always taught that both the O.T. Jews and the N.T. Christians would
have found the notion incomprehensible--as do I.

Don't we christians believe in the resurrection of the body?

Or do you mean by material simply the stuff made of the 100+ elements

Christian anti-Semitism comes from the obvious fact that the Jews should
know the Hebrew Scriptures better than anyone else, yet they did not
convert to Christianity en mass, thus rejecting ""Christian Love.""

I don't see why not. Where are the rest of the tribal people? What
happened to the tribes of the Americas? Culture is seen as different and
undesirable in the West, particular in the US with its failed ""melting
pot concept."" Most tribes have been hunted to extinction, the Hebrew
tribe is one of the few survivers from the Neolithic. Of course it
becomes difficult at times to separate Christianity from the Western
experience, so perhaps you are right, perhaps it would have been a better 
world if the cultural experiment in Christianity never happened.

Three, actually.  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse
before.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and
neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and
you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the
horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a
plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit
(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Are you sorry you asked yet?

Excellently put!

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I
like.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdale
that was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was
private and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and
I enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will
never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently
about having to help pay for it.)

However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to
give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact,
we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely
because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other
issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the
sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just
whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech
should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can
imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority
on a case-by-case basis.

Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly
what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.

Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a
case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a
case-by-case basis.

There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with
free enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a
government that interferes with free enterprise in an ""efficient""
manner; I call it political market failure.

Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to
swallow the ""whole libertarian agenda.""

Subject: Single chip receiver for FSK?
Reply-To: jra@law7.DaytonOH.NCR.COM (John Ackermann x 2966)
Organization: NCR Corporation -- Law Department
Lines: 21

My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112
to 250 kB/sec -- packet radio use.  No fancy modulation scheme, just
wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.

I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there
are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.

My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver ""back
end"" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'm
particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any
current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a
normal IF filter can be used?

Any suggestions?

John

Actually, Gaetti's first year with California was 1991.  His .632 DA wasn't
out of line with his career averages, and his .616 was actually below average
in 1988.  But check out the last three years at the Metrodome.

1990
Gaetti  .655
AL Avg  .604
1991
Pags    .744
Leius   .653
Al Avg  .620
1992
Leius   .680
AL Avg  .603

For the last three years, the highest DAs in either league have been posted
by Minnesota players -- three different ones, including one (Pags) who was
mediocre to horrible elsewhere.  That doesn't *prove* a park effect is at
work, any more than San Diego's horrible infield numbers prove a park effect
is at work.  But it looks like a strong possibility to me.

Are the Moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into

People die for lies all the time.

Was Hitler a liar? How about Napoleon, Mussolini, Ronald Reagan? We spend
millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? So the

about some things.

Why do you think he healed people, because the Bible says so? But if God
doesn't exist (the other possibility) then the Bible is not divinely
inspired and one can't use it as a piece of evidence, as it was written by
unbiased observers.

Possibly self-fulfilling prophecy (ie he was aware what he should do in
order to fulfil these prophecies), possibly selective diting on behalf of
those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the
general; public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such

the words of raving fictional 'prophecy'.

------------------------------------------------------------------
If you insist on giving me names/titles I did not ask for you could at
least spell them correctly. /sigh.

   when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that 
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE, 
   and hence ALL their actions, their courts, their laws are illegitimate on 
   the ground of occupied territories.

No, I am _not_ neglecting that, I'm merely asking you whether the existance
of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right
to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. We can get back to the 
question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have 
not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.

   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my
   point in the post, that you ""responded to"". The point is that since Israel 
   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights 
   to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic 
   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.

If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then 
tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?

   The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because
   any system can solve it. 
   The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). 

I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for 
all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that 
mistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your 
reply.

   Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) 
   said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:

	   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal

	   The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of

	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to
	   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be 
	   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to
	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.""
				   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967
				   (""Courtesy"" of Marc Afifi)

Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd
be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to 
a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he
wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will
make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to 
make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get 
something back.


   ""We"" and ""our"" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which). 

   Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the 
   imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !

   I think that is fair enough .

No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve 
the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.
Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land. 


   ""The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children"".

Oh, and by the way, let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
a real bummer, when I try giving your posts any credit.

These substitutes exist, and at this time are available. Its the future

1) GHG-12

Get it from People's Welding Supply 800-382-9006


2) butane/propane  

You can mix this yourself so no one can ever regulate it away.
Just make sure you use good quality (dry) gases.

Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and
characters on each side, which is useless.

I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183).
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.
Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font
graphics displayed however!!

Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred
character?  Has anyone been able to get this character displayed
from a CorelDraw TTF?

But why would you want to use RBI?   RBI is an attempt to measure is some
combination of clutch hitting and power hitting.  If you believe in
clutch hitting, then look at how the guy hit with RISP.  If you want to
see how good of a slugger he is, then look at his slugging average.  

In terms of evaluating players, RBI totals are better than nothing.  But
why use them when so many better stats are out there?

I cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported.
A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which
were protected by the Greek police. Photographs of Greek policemen 
preventing Turks from this non brain minority were all over Greek press.

Minorities in Turkish treated like that ? YOur own countrymen die

You seem to be intelligent, so before presenting Turkey as the paradise of

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court
a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and
plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity
to listen to some of the ""creative excuses"" offered the judge by others.

After listening to a number of ""Well, I was passing a very slow truck
that suddenly speed up"" versions, I decided that the judge had heard
just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than
impressed with any of them.

This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a
rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.
He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph
zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had
alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.

The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose
and said in his sternest voice: ""Well son, those are some pretty
fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for
your self?""

""Well Sir"", meekly the defenant replied, ""I just was over to my
buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home.""
He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and
was doing 110 mph on his way home.

The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the
maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him
to attend remedial drivers training school.

Isn't America Great??

[most recent changes, 15 March 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw]

               === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* ===

This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general
description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and
some suggested guidelines for discussions.  The keywords `Monthly Posting'
will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of
newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos
groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't
understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at
least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please
subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the
documentation provided there.

Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:

rec.autos.tech

is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,
construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely
inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.

rec.autos.sport

is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving
automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply
to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,
spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are
largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are
inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.
Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid
advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)

rec.autos.driving

is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.
Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert
your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.

rec.autos.vw

is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership
of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,
Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing
list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence
of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many
different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be
created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as
a mailing list.

rec.audio.car

is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,
the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and
so is mentioned here.

rec.autos.antique

is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years
old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)

alt.hotrod

is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the
rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing
list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing
performance vehicles.

alt.autos.rod-n-custom

also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar
American hobby of customizing older cars.

alt.autos.karting

for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.

rec.autos

is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.


Crossposting:

Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on
the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear
in all of the newsgroups listed.

Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on
Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is
appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular
audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector
articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are
almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact
that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or
rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.

Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually
inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is
truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:
to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.

Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in
particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of
radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.

Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about
the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in
rec.autos.

It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of
articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to
misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these
three.  The life you save may be your own.

Distribution:

There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to
(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution
field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve
as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.

The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, 
the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,
New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the
following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article
headers, and on article content.

1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford
Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in
either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange
reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)

2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which
your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences
between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,
all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel
injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These
differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.
Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant
spread of misinformation.

3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;
in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas
Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition
of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used
abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos
reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.

4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when
possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can
(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state
abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted
to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put
""ny,nj"" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated
values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so
you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely
to be supported in your area.

The Dangers of Overgeneralization:

To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:
Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is
true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a
1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly
different from those in Idaho.

The Need for Adequate Specification:

When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;
e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,
model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be
quite useless.


Concerning Lemons:

At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or
two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by
announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all
`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from
the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they
cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful
information.


Concerning Flames:

As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most
likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how
to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section
of this posting):

If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a
minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and
you'll get exactly what you deserve.

If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can
cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe
bald, unsupported assertions.

Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.


Asking the Question:

It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please
send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to
end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest
I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses
to this request'.

Answering the Question:

If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.
Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on
defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --
it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly
address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see
your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and
self-righteous.


Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:

Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of
them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings
about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them
ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is
difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some
of these topics include the following:

1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con

2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of
    radar detectors.

3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.

4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why
    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue
    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)

5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's
    right to own and operate a radar detector

6)  `Buy American' discussions

7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates

8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible

9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?
      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the
          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.
          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]

   Not necessarily.  I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme
is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange,
either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme
like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared
session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone
company or some other online central authority generates a session key and
sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of
having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for
a copy of the session key for each call.
 
   Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of
every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will
be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally-
signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,
stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to
everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the
security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your
designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.
 
   It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to
use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair
and verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call
most people and establish secure communications....

Walther,
I'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card
and screen would have without flickering. I'd only suggest using the color
screen if it does 800*600 without flickering. If this is not too small for
your tastes at a 14""....
Personally I'd prefer the mono-screen as I always have quite a few windows
open. If you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the
color 'surplus' is worth trading in  the smaller size. If you want to
develop programs you will always have to check the colors. I used a
14"" mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors looked
I choose on a color screen.

Organization: Dayton Microcomputer Association; Dayton, Ohio

The primary problem in human nature is a ""fragmentation of being.""
Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and
evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.

The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of
being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's
rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of
the Scriptures.

Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words
of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was
that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the
Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called ""theosis,"" or ""deification.""

One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,
and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture
of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs
was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the
Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,
their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly
irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in
their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This
is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.

The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it
were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,
its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.

Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of
innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining
of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His
masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?

God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral
value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There
is no other way to achieve union with God.

Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.
He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,
and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,
not in His essence, but in His energies.

The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it
with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the
answer to his dilemma in vs 25.

                                 Mark

Does anyone know the particulars on the Senate File 303?
Does this bill allow or deny off-duty police from carrying concealed?

From what information that I have, Iowa has a discretionary permit policy
on CCW.  If S 303 allows police(off-duty) to carry concealed then I would
be inclined to oppose it.  I don't believe off-duty police officers should
have any more rights than civilians.  If law or policy prevents law-abiding
citizens from being armed for self defense then why should off-duty police
officer be treated any differently.

Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US
Government? 
Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you?
The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will
stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you? 

Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great
beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is
not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church 
stating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation
and made it all null and void.. 

What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your
services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what
ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..
Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reason
or another, but who will give you a ""home"".. Such as Saudia Arabia or
whatever..
There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and
offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..
Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.
The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will
not care.. 
If your worried about the US, do the same thing..

Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many
other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what
ever..
Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a
little bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to
piss off.. If my ancestors thought the way many today think, Id have been born
in Central Europe just north of the Black Sea..

I just read a good book, ""Tower of the Gods"" Interesting..

Do you have a terminal cold? Karabag is 'Turkish' and will remain 
'Turkish'. Here we are, almost at the end of the 20th century, and 
a whole community, the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag, 
is facing forced assimilation, torture and murder on one hand and 
forced exodus, expulsion and genocide on the other, all because 
of their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself: 
is the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human 
rights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to 
let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The number
of Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage
gangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truth
and on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.

        The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92

        By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday

        The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be 
        little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian 
        fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. 

        Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the 
        Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of 
        how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25 
        February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the 
        surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in 
        one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were 
        shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I 
        also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift 
        hospital in a string of railway carriages. 

        Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by 
        Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov 
        Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to 
        his  town.   "" So where are the rest?"".  Some might have  taken 
        prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the 
        mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to 
        retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of 
        cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees. 

        One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at 
        first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting 
        to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict. 
        But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored 
        personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend 
        themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the 
        forests. In the small hours, the massacre started. 

        Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken 
        prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that 
        troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack 
        Khojaly. ""It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.""

Automotive Mailing Lists (Electronic Mail, that is):

[last updated 3/17/93; new lotus, exotic cars list subscription info;
   added Portland, OR motorsports list, Corvair list, Triumph TR8 list -- rpw]

There are a number of electronic mailing lists on the network devoted to
various special automotive topics.

To the best of my knowledge, all the lists appearing here have open
membership policies.  It is my policy not to list `closed' mailing lists
here.

Most mailing lists provide separate addresses for administrative
queries and for general mail; where separate administrative
addresses exist, I have listed those below, as the general addresses
are not appropriate for inquirys and requests.

I think this is a big leap sex->depression.  One example is myself,
where no sex->depression :)  But, seriously 1) promiscuity is on a decline,
depression is not and 2) it might be more reasonable to say 
depression->promiscuity.  I think depression is more likely to come
from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and
promiscuity is used as an escape.
Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an
emotional bond, I don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of)
marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as
what is expected from a married couple.  Of course, this is just 
my opinion.

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way. A look in the old
RCA picture tube manual backs this up, as does SAMS Reference Data
handbook. The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT
(not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating) is referred to as a
""dag"" as well as the outer coating.

Thankfully, I didn't need to go to a f****** library to find it, either.

You'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing
in the new colours.

Use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g & b values (in the range
from 0-63 for most cards) for a particular palette colour (in the
range from 0-255 for 256 colour modes).

Then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and
the result should be ok.

You might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have
more than 256 unique rgb triplets, for a 256 colour mode.

Subject: Hits Stolen -- Second Base 1992
Summary: Stolen Hits for all second basemen
Keywords: second defense
Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL
Lines: 117

Disclaimer -- This is for fun.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called
""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would not
make with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats
for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Kurt
Stillwell would not have made.""

OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,
fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we
replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out
making ability, how many extra hits would go by?

To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double
Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).

Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or
DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't
take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article.

The short version -- definition of terms
HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell
NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder
NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.
DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

Why such a bizzare formula?  Basically, it's designed to be added into the
OPS, with the idea that ""a run prevented is as important as a run scored"".
The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option
known as ""differential ready"".  Apparently land-based
beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS 
receiver (with differential option installed).

How does this system work?  What frequency is used for
the land-based beacons?

Thanks in advance,

Given the description of the algorithm given, the only plausible

It was no criticism of Islam for a change, it was a criticism of the
arguments used. Namely, whenever people you identify as Muslims are
the victims of the attacks of others, they are used an argument for
the bad situation of Muslims. But whenever deeds by Muslim that victimize
others are named, they do not count as an argument because what these
people did was not done as a true Muslims. No mention is made how Muslims
are the cause of a bad situation of another party.
 
Double standards.

                              10:00 AM PDT

Flight Sequence C8 is active, the Spacecraft subsystems and instrument
payload performing well in Array Normal Spin and outer cruise
configuration, with uplink and downlink via the High Gain Antenna; uplink
at 125 bps, downlink at the 2 K Engineering data rate.

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all
payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault
protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory
was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for
Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight
Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload
Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning
beginning at 10:30 AM.

Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to
perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for
analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator
testing will take place on Monday .

The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with
activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to
include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due
to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument
calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the
spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.
This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements
which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require
the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state
and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points
in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.

Today, the spacecraft is 22,971,250 km (14,273,673 mi.) from Mars
travelling at a velocity of 2.09 kilometers/second (4,677 mph) with
respect to Mars.  One-way light time is approximately 10 minutes, 38
seconds.

  If the emphasis is on the ""in general"", then of course you're
  correct, since you haven't really said anything.  If we restrict
  our observations to practiced religions, there are lots of
  examples of god mandated genocide.  Just ask the Canaanites.  The

You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I
see it used normally.

And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to
""the real world"".

Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe
and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning
those perceptions.

It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see.
Values are ... well they are what I value.
They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience
rather than not, and so on.

Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are
applicable to everyone.

>If there is no such thing as objective value, then science can not 
>objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head.

I don't agree.
Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are
accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on
my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe)
versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.

But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the 
perceptions :-)

>Simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said
>to be more useful than a set of tarot cards.  

I don't see why.
'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period.
Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or
can't be shown to be accurate.
Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.

Values - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.

No?

However, I feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings (see

Many people are interested, but have no input.  I will restate that your last
sentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group.  If people have
input, they will give it.  If they do not, YOU should not make them feel 
compelled (sp?) to respond.

Subject: Candida(yeast) Bloom, Fact or Fiction
Lines: 187
Nntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu
Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine

I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.
Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. 
Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women 
poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did 
not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I 
see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  

Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have 
no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that 
balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians 
who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go 
from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and 
then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling 
quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon
but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a 
quack.  

I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten 
years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were 
raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their 
farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to 
entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is 
about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition 
either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I 
know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at 
least a few ""enlightened"" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really 
too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if 
they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the 
medical profession.

In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with ""good"" bacteria after 
antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not 
have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with ""good"" bacteria is 
needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all 
kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small 
and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are 
nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune 
system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike 
the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce 
toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of 
these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up 
residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this 
happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.
Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals 
and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what 
vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling 
Elaine's doctor a quack.

Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly 
called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a 
yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.
Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it 
requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  

Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of 
normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing
factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral 
course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain 
much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in 
it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely 
survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides 
the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In 
diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little 
buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but 
some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on 
the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to ""treat"" it.
If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
nondiscript.  


Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in 
the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the 
vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system 
ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless 
they broach the mucus membrane ""barrier"".  If they do, an inflammatory 
response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A 
from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than 
they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin 
A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane 
barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong 
inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  

While diabetics can suffer from a candida ""bloom"" the  most common cause of 
this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which 
knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main 
competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are 
available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not 
use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of 
the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus 
inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum 
antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate 
just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring 
vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.

But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by 
the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to 
return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of 
the problem is addressed(lack of a ""good"" bacterial flora in the body and/or 
poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective 
therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving 
organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not 
grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is 
the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum 
antibiotics).  

In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good 
reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very 
favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and 
humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to 
minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  

If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even 
blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the 
bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology 
occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool 
for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first 
place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong 
but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan 
has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool 
specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of 
false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant 
basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have 
colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a 
doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.

Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria 
tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline 
during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. 
Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal 
problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of 
Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of 
the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina 
problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year 
until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting 
scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had 
the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some 
digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she 
used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex 
returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic 
GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
patients is a non-existent syndrome.

The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria 
which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  
If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through 
aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.
But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system 
needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and 
some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans 
are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of 
the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent 
disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).
 
Some of the above material was obtained from ""Natural Healing"" by Mark 
Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human 
nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in 
the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely 
important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in 
the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida 
blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate 
intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI 
system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out 
grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and 
fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check 
once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.

If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, 
fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably 
accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin 
A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice 
from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our 
time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved 
your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly 
seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

I've experienced this, back when I was young(er) and (more) foolish...

My first bike used to track extremely true.  Going down the highway,
I would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas
steady, slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest, riding
without any hands.  If I needed to turn, I'd shift my weight into the
turn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars!
Granted, it wouldn't turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn
a bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input
to the bar normally associated with countersteering.

As I've said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any
input they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious.  Whereas that
may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances,
possibly for years at a stretch, I can't think of anybody who'd argue
that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar
in a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.

You can include postscript epsi files in xfig (encapsulated postscript

to draw over the postscript file.

There a eps to epsi converter: eps2epsi (perl program),

This is the wrong way to quantify things.  The smuggler would

price out a crate of good quality handguns.

See how easy it is to make a functional firearm.

The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the
right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and
went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he
missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,
reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.

Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially
behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and
just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch.

Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is
impossible.

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first
nine games.

I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull
hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan.

First, what the fuck is NASA doing wasting my tax dollars doing
policy papers on stuff far outside of their purvew/mission?
                                                                         
Second, this isn't a problem of economics.  This is a problem of
the incremental accumulation of police-state powers by our government.
 
How, exactly, do you put a price on the loss of freedom of a society?
Maybe use the dollars/life lost calculations for the extra people
killed by the gov.  The pain and suffering cases for those tortured.
The dollars/life lost caused by the inevitable collapse of the economy,
and all the secondary effects of diseases, diet, etc.  Plus, the
inevitable collapse of the economy as the gov controls it, becomes 
corrupt, etc.

Do us a favor.  Resign rather than right this paper for NASA.  Go
do useful work for the society.

You missed something.  I think it takes off vertically and is intended

you  need to massage few switches in your system.ini.
in the virtual memory section, flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the 
associated driver (wdctl or some such) switch on.  this will enable
32bit access, but be sure you can use it, as not all hard drives
and controllers support it !

1)  throw out WINDOZE
2)  install OS/2

Fascism with a Friendly Face: Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of 
Anyone?
Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge

""The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that 
Hitler was original and showed initiative."" 
--Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network, 
October 27, 1992.

(NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of 
Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to 
Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was 
independent and sharp as a scalpel.
	My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At 
least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the 
idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for 
delivery.
	Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the 
most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are 
noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with 
passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in 
fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost 
identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German 
election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and 
enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their 
ideological quilt.
	The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening 
pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the 
German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway 
line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) 
was ""betrayed to France by a representative of his government"" when 
there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.
	In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as 
the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost 
succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic 
claim in his introduction that ""in a school or during a commencement 
ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional."" Of 
course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of 
God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is 
too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.
	Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, 
my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern 
American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version 
of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), 
and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen 
million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book 
after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in 
Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.
	Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily 
three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary 
propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way 
Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a 
translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the 
printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since 
radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of 
luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to 
spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop 
$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.
	But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some 
cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of 
their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these 
days.)
	Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf 
Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of 
ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio 
program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk 
show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He 
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows 
that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the 
opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh 
earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a 
RICO indictment.
	On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of 
material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For 
example:

On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society
	Hitler: ""Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who 
individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly 
perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in 
order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of 
imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight 
for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of 
thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises"" 
(page 577).
	Limbaugh: ""Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The 
show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase ""with half my 
brain tied behind my back to make it even""] denotes the egress of mental 
aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree 
with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media 
will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking 
and screaming all the way."" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)

On Religion as the Basis of a Nation
	Hitler: ""In this world human culture and civilization are 
inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his 
decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without 
culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord 
sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the 
expulsion from Paradise."" (Page 581.)
	Limbaugh: ""America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... 
But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or 
ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a 
charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools 
for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of 
American education has declined ever since?"" (pages 274-5.)

On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse
	Hitler: ""The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... 
One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and 
theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... 
Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays 
must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the 
service of a moral idea of State and culture."" (pages 346 and 348.)
	Limbaugh: ""Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that 
Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people 
who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality 
and monagamy. They disparage American heroes."" (page 254.)

On the News Meida
	Hitler: ""The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of 
gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass 
by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the 
people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of 
slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews."" (Page 331.)
	Limbaugh: ""Elements of The Media have jumped on the 
bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been 
replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During 
the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global 
network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't 
realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that 
therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided 
and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania."" (pages 270 and 268.)

*     *     *
	
To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but 
ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.
	After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that 
haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened 
Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed 
Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, 
Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to 
depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American 
radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the 
Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for 
The Fascist States of America.
	And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the 
radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only 
wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.

Summary: address for NRA - Right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons

Could someone email me a USNail address for the NRA? I'd like to write them
a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd
amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended.

People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment
to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they
did in Waco.

After all, from what I know of the Federalist papers, it is this kind of
tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against.

Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters!

We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they
intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population,
we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would
have ever thought it would happen here!

I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov.
SUSPECTS child abuse. Maybe yours! Maybe mine!
And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the
2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses
tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.

Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries.
Now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a
half of civilians.

""First they came for the Jews, but I did not stop them, because I was
not a Jew: Then they came for the catholics, but I did not stop them
because I was not a catholic! Then they came for the lutherans, but
there was now no one left to stop them!"" Rev. Martin Niemoller.
(probably didn't get it verbatim, but you get the idea).

If the NRA reads this, then never mind about the address.

  To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:

  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people 
in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. 
Paul ""Pioneer Press"" wrote an article giving the ""inside scoop"" on the 
issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible 
candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic 
Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty 
confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will 
ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other 
two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the 
inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) 
believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, 
because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed 
until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  
However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, 
because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for 
conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to 
this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future 
viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even 
further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of 
knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging 
Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be
be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, 
which may happen.
	Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are 
Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota ""
Ice Demons?"") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't 
been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the 
Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in 
as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see 
Hartford and Tampa show up there either.	So, Minnesota may end up 
getting another team, but it may take a few years.

	
	Go Sabres!

I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system:

486-33 DX, 16 mb of ram
on a Novell 3.11 network
Monitor:  NEC 4FGe, capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate

Major considerations:

I expect I will work mostly in windows, but with some DOS
applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word
processing, database and communications--not much intensive graphics.

With a 15"" monitor, I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256
colors seems plenty, but I'd like like the image to be sharp, fast,
and rock solid.

Other considerations:

I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some
companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party
development of drivers.

I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability
than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking.

I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest
in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and
upgrading to local bus later).

I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well.

If you have any advice for me, I'd love to hear it via email or post.

Thanks.

Yes.  Unfortunately, there is also the concept that the owner of a car
is not responsible for the actions of any (authorized) user of the car.
That's one of the biggest arguments against photo-radar ticketing
systems.

Trouble with that is, you then have no recourse if a mis-issued ticket
or a clerical error on a computer follow you around.  The City of Chicago
(the informal motto of which being ""The City the Works"") issues dozens
of parking tickets each year to people who have never set foot (or tire)
in the city.

The lengthy article you quote doesn't imply this.  It only states that
it is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin
to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several
captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.

In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.

Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or
may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence
of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to
acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US
warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has
declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.

The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.

This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've
been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name
of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests.
Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.  

Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without
publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how
has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives,
friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place
where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of
people whose whereabouts are unknown?  People who are presumed to be
imprisoned?  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've
come to associate with Yigal Arens before.  Perhaps from now on, we
should.

No, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of the
country, you don't need to be known as an LD ""specialist"" to see a large
number of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of
underdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just
about every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,
he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not
the only orthopedists in the town.

Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the
*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage
manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by
neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem
we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD
patient.

He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the
patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to
the knees).

Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.

On the other side of the fence, I owned a Bieffe off-road helmet.
Took what I would consider a minor fall, and had visible damage
to the shell.  Yes, the helmet did its job.  But the damage/impact
ratio was scary.  I own Bell Moto-5 now, have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact (we do this frequently in MX),
and don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons.  My

I know of a similar incident about 3 years ago.  A climatologist( Ithink 
that was his profession) named Iben Browning predicted that an earthquake 
would hit the New Madrid fault on Dec.3.  Some schools in Missouri that were 
on the fault line actually cancelled school for the day.  Many people 
evacuated New Madrid and other towns in teh are.  I wouldn't be suprised if 
there were more journalists in the area than residents.  Of course, teh 
earthquake never occured.  HOw do I know about his?  I used to live in 
Southern Illinois and the lican middle school was built directly on the 
fault line.  No we still had school... We laughed at the poor idiots who 
believed the prediction. :):):):)

Bob, if you're wanting an excuse to convert to Christianity, you gonna have 
to look elsewhere.

There are a couple.  I am personally using screenpeace, which is a

The yearly chest x-ray provides a minute amount of radiation.  It is

Appletalk network, hooked up with a DayStar Digital LT200 MC LocalTalk
Interface Board, running on a PS/2 Model 70. I'm using the AppleShare PC
software for file server and network access. It works fine under DOS or the
Window or OS/2 DOS box. But when I try to load it *before* Windows, so that
every application I run could get access to it, the machine crashes hard as
soon as I start up an application. And of course, things look pretty hopeless
for OS/2 (but who knows). 

So, does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup?

(the date I have for this is 1-26-93)

note Clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph..  I guess
this statement doesen't contradict what you said, though.

--- cut here ---

        WASHINGTON (UPI) -- The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh
start, President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation
of Police Commisioners convention in Washington.
        In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural,
Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War ``would make
everything so far seem so half-hearted that for all practical
purposes this war is only beginning now.'' He repeatedly emphasized
his view that ``regardless of what has been tried, or who has tried
it, or how long they've been trying it, this is Day One to me.''
The audience at the convention, whose theme is ``How do we spell
fiscal relief?  F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E,'' interrupted Clinton frequently
with applause.
        Clinton's program, presented in the speech, follows the
outline given in his campaign position papers: a cabinet-level Drug
Czar and ``boot camps'' for first-time youthful offenders.  He did,
however, cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement
methods.  ``This year's crime bill will have teeth, not bare gums,''
Clinton said.  In particular, his administration will place strict
controls on data formats and protocols, and require the registration
of so-called ``cryptographic keys,'' in the hope of denying drug
dealers the ability to communicate in secret.  Clinton said the
approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground
economic activity, such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders who
live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.''
        Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won
``because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last
November, everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of
urgency about fighting the drug menace.  The advocates of
legalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good at
making noise,'' Clinton said.  ``But when the American people cast
their ballots, it only proved what I knew all along -- that the
advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe.''

I've tried calling Transoft Corp about this and have either gotten the

Anyone want Transoft's phone number?

I seem to recall that there was an article in Radio Electronics about this
subject. In fact I have a copy of the article in front of me, but I can't
find anywhere in the article a refrence as to what month it was in. The system
they describe uses an automobile ignition coil for the high voltage. The 
article even includes some information on what kind of film to use and where 
to get it. 

Hope this helps.

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Contact:  OASIS (310) 364-2290

   15 April 1993                                Los Angeles, CA

     LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY L.A.
  ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD

   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National 
Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-
inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.
Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science
Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.

   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space
Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell
International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or
coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David
Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.

   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal
experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build
the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a
potential to power the globe.

   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half
from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.

   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous
source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever
increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space
Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the
National Space Society, which is an international non-profit
organization that promotes development of the space frontier.
The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

Why are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip
micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only
costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed
the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,
use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely
on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want
to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut
you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.

If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of 
maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET
to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than 
you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add
a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count
screams up to 9.

PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This
application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the 
programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.

							April 1, 1993


I am participating in an NL-league that uses standard Rotisserie rules
except that the following catagories are used:

For position players:
	lowest batting average
	strike-outs
	caught-stealing
	errors

For pitchers:
	losses
	blown saves
	higest ERA
	'taters allowed

This is the fifth year that I've participated in this Blowtisserie
league.  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that
I had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average
which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up
for this by helping me lock first place in errors).  Anyway,
someone offered:

Andres Gallaraga for Bud Black

I can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott.
However, I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season.
Should I make the trade or not?

Your comments will be appreciated.

Well, looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various
places at the same time, which would indicate that this was a planned
action. I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't *deliberately* start a possible
fire, having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier 
method. Looking at the careful operation, and use of tear gas
that as I know don't start fires, it is less likely that this 
was the case.

Sorry, but my bets are on fanatical people keen to start
Armageddon -- theirs.

Cheers,
Kent

Subject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring
Lines: 163
Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1
Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NY

There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding
practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:

The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or
the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to
carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the
voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It
should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the
normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in
the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding
conductor.  

Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages
on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding
conductors to provide reliable operation  (""orange"" outlets are often used for
this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in
many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read
both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on
installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated
grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors
back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service
entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many
of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide
a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. 

The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is
referred to in the code as the ""identified"" conductor and is supposed to be
white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in
most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance
panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household
service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which
attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  

The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In
the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the
circuit from the panel to the load device.  

Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding
conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance
from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but
measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,
under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the
grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of
the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since
there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also
no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment
has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ""U""
ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. 
The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few
tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not
present a shock hazard.  

HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact
with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,
a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to
flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you
will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)
Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in
some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of
inadequate size, causing it to overheat.

With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a
short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may
flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which
increases the possibility for shock or fire.  

Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on
the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often
causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in
technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.

The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as
well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for
lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back
to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded
objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses
quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the
dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it
flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause
corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,
and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop
between the ""hot"" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the
water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. 
(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not
it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)

Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any
sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service
entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have
a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this
application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the
grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding
screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above
ground, with the possible problems listed above.

The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one
building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be
used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate
wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. 
These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days
before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to
have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to
have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place
of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate
neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings
(since most current is in the 220 volt ""hots"" except at some low settings, the
wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. 
So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,
it's primarily for lightning protection.

People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding
conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in ""romex"" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere
there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good
grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes
is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under
the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this
aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does
its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall
tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding
locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  

""Greenfield"" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty
sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have
the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and
inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the
greenfield.

""Wiremold"" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes
often prevents good contact, and the ""feed"" to the wiremold extension is often
from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold
box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and
the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were ""hot"" with
120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator
here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one
of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a
ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in
the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can ""bond"" the wire to the
box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.

On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets
when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them
without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the
protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't
install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is
desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is
connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,
whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something
provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded
GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93
code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be
renumbered though.) 

We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more
to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

I missed the presentations given in the morning session (when Shea gave
his ""rambling and almost inaudible"" presentation), but I did attend
the afternoon session. The meeting was in a small conference room. The
speaker was wired with a mike, and there were microphones on the table for
the panel members to use. Peons (like me) sat in a foyer outside the
conference room, and watched the presentations on closed circuit TV. In
general, the sound system was fair to poor, and some of the other
speakers (like the committee member from the Italian Space Agency)
also were ""almost inaudible.""

Shea didn't ""lead the formal presentation,"" in the sense of running
or guiding the presentation. He didn't even attend the afternoon
session. Vest ran the show (President of MIT, the chair of the

Who knows in this legal climate, but there is tremendous legal precendent

it was done all the time.  It has been done sporadically all along

When the PLO moved into Lebanon and became, in parts of Lebanon, an

non-Palestinean and Palestinean alike.  They are simply Standard

KS, I see you're wanting Malcolm's response. Allow me one last inter-
jection then please:

Distinguishing among the religious Jews, you've excepted the Messianic
for obvious reasons. Specifically, are you saying it's these religious 
Jews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy, 
rather than by faith, who won't agree?  Orthodox Jews?  

As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains 
unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often 
look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.
For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so 
sure the atheists can be counted out. 

For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,
or David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to which
one adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it
depends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might 
understand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.

I somehow started to doubt technical competence of the
people who designed the system.  Why on the Earth split the
80-bit key in 40-bit parts to keep them in escrow separately
(having 40 bit and large volumes of data voice links produce
it should be relatively easy to break it) when they simply
could keep 80-bit sequences in N (N>=2) independent places
and then XOR all the partial keys to get the actual key (N-1
sequences should obviously be selected randomly and Nth is the
actual key XOR-ed with the random sequences).

(Or is it a conspiracy? 1/2 :-)

Subject: Upgrade from 286 to 486 help needed!!!
Organization: Indiana University
Lines: 27


Greetings,

        Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info, 
please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension),
and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.

        The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big
case. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-rom
reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far:
1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case?
2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk
removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I
have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?
3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? 
I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in?
What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost?
Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if
I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC- 
quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle
than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.

Any input is welcome.

Thank you.

060 fastest, then Pentium, with the first versions of the PowerPC
somewhere in the vicinity.

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed.
Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and
I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory
system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If
you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory
every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but
it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.

And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock
speed as is the 68030.

I tend to use XIconifyWindow to achieve this effect...  Have you tried that?

 So-Called Cool-Hot boxes have been advetised for several years.  I recall
Damark advertising them in a recent catalog.  Problem with the units is they do
a sh***y job of keeping food cold/warm.  The peliter devices used just don't
seem to have enough punch to keep up.  If you want something hot, you need to
heat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats
only moderately warm.  Same goes for cold items.

 You'de probably be better off getting a good Coleman(tm) cooler and stocking
up on ""blue ice"" blocks.

 Same as above.  Not enough ""punch"" in them to keep/get things cold/hot.

Here are the standings after game 1 of each of the divisional semi-finals.
(Hey, look who's #4!)  I'll try to post the standings after ""each game""
(i.e. every two days).

I managed to recover the email lost up to Saturday night, so all I'm missing
is mail that arrived between early Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon.
Many people re-sent their teams, so you may have received two replies back
from me.  If your team name is not on this list, please resend your team
to me and I'll see what I can do.  Any kind of ""proof"" you sent it on the
weekend will help your case.  :-)  Seriously, this is only a fun pool and
I trust each person to be honest.

Again, sorry for any inconvenience, and I hope the pool is still fun for you.

I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.
I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such
""storys"" about them. OK ?
Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:
   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.
         It has an hightech ""boiler"" but the rest is still verry verry 
         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-
         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.
         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find
         a chapter about the ""CARNOT-process"" which describes how to
         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason
         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an
         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one 
         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water
         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the 
         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to
         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and ""cold""
         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.
         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of
         energy that carnot will give them.
         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !
         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,
         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in
         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
         radioactive pollution of the environment !
         
   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-
         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still
         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere
         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with
         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the
         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.
         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures
         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. 

   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever
         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the
         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem
         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have
         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and
         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.

The HGA isn't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might ""cook the
focal elements"", nor is its figure good on those scales--the problem is
that the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to Venus-level sunlight,
lest like Icarus' wings it melt.  (I think it was glues and such, as well
as electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remain
furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small
sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA.
(A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus.)

As usual, David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The
proposal clearly states:

=> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
=> accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
=> telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

It speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David.
Maybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.

That's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to
think. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost
anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean
secure) encryption is used. What will happen when (""if""? Ha!
optimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT
SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of
these ""some"" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes
on the former (""almost nobody"") - which is clearly an improvement -
and ""forgets"" to mention the drawbacks of the latter (""guaranteed"").
Yes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the
strong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.

> Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.

It's not just ""continued ability"". It's -guaranteed- ability.

Yeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's
take small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't
think about the future. Trust us.

It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the
intention. They, unlike you, read what they write.

Yes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will
allow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure,
of course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the
jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The
new proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell,
that will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that
mentally pervert...

Great. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm)
has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any
details whatsoever and has concluded that it is ""highly secure"". I
guess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the
two major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government
can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto
experts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David
Sternlight has already done all the job for them...

""Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of
future safety, do not deserve either."" This (or something like that; I
don't have the exact quote, but the meaning is the same) has been said
by one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works more
carefully, if you have the brains to understand them, of course.

The main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure
cryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying ""we
guarantee that every American will still have the full right to use
any kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as
just a default, voluntary implementation"", there would have been much
less opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise
you that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?

> return we get access to high-security crypto.

No, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.

While the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is
not done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily
breakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable
by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who
has only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't
you simply trust them, huh?

It is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It
might be even easier, but until there is some evidence, this is just a
wild speculation.

The trapdoors -are- there. In government's hands. The keys.

Legitimate? And who decides what communications are legitimate? Oh, I

It's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide
who has the right to use it ""legitimately""...

Impossible, since you are demonstrating the same level of incompetence

Unfortunately, I have yet to see you posting a technically competent

Sorry, I should have been more specific.  The 750 SS ran the quater in
12.10 @ 108.17.  The last small V-twin Duc we got in the US (and the 400 is
a Pantah based V-twin) was the 500SL Pantah, and it ran a creditable 13.0 @
103.  Modern carbs and what not should put the 400 in the high 12s at 105.

BTW, FZR 400s ran mid 12s, and the latest crop of Japanese 400s will out
run that.  It's hard to remember, but but a new GOOF2 will clobber an old
KZ1000 handily, both in top end and roll-on.  Technology stands still for
no-one...

Really?  I don't get it... Genesis first says that God created the
earth, then the animals, then humans; then it turns around and says
that humans were created before animals!  How can you escape this

You can probably get this information by calling your public health
department in your county (in Pittsburgh, they give the shots free,
as well).  There are bulletins in medical libraries that give
recommendations, or you could call the infectious diseases section
of the medicine department of your local medical school.  You also
will probably want to talk about Malaria prophylaxis.  You will
need your doctor to get the prescription.

Could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a
gun?

Have you considered a non-interventionist policy?  If market reform does
happen, Russia will certainly get *private* capital at *private* risk to
help their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the same
reason.  If they don't reform, then our government will probably
consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help
them.

Then their's the ideological point.  We want to ""win"" Russia over to
our type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit
over everyone's finances?

It seems instead of gridlock on any scale, we have aid to Russia,
expensive space programs, national charity that doesn't help the poor,
and probably, studies of drunken goldfish.  I think *limited* government
is more key than how democratic it is.

If you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should
be VERY libertarian.  Consider it a compromise.  How much money would
your fellow Russia-aiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose
weren't using the same government machine to steal money from you
and your group for causes you don't support?

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume
no new launcher development.  If you assume new launcher development, with
lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don't want to
build something HLV-sized anyway.

Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans.  It
doesn't take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large

Remember, when you elect a president of the united states, it's not

I'm not up on the details of US patent law, but I think this is incorrect.
There is a ""reasonable use"" exemption for *copyright*.  There is none for
*patents*.  The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow; R&D work
is exempt but personal use is not.  That is, it's okay to experiment with
a patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your
stereo), even if it's only your own private practical use.

Of course, it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detected
or that you will ever be sued over it.

And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-
Bernstein.  See his book, ""Discovering"".  Ring structures for benzene
had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him.
The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors
of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.

I don't think ""extra-scientific"" is a very useful phrase in a discussion
of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational
is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases
of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.

For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of
enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a
friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but
Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking
at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he
lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic
acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.

Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers
(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because
he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks
contained fantasies of becoming the ""Newton of mirror-image life,"" which
he never admitted publically.

Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery
started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile
and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.
Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the
student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the
student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the
research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery
(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).

Just a shot here, but ya never know:

I once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player 
at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.  For a 
while, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and the 
amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder 
joints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.  
I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably 
lousy heat sinking.

You said ""a nice Alpine"" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higher

First, I am not a doctor.  I know about this because I have been
through it.

It sounds like tonsilitis (lit. swollen tonsils).  Feel under your jaw
hinge for a swelling on each side.  If you find them, its tonsilitis.
I've had this a couple of times in the past.  The doctor prescribed a
weeks course of penicillin and that cleared it up.

In my case it was associated with glandular fever, which is a viral
infection which (from my point of view) resembled flu and tonsilitis
that kept coming back for a year or so.  There is a blood test for
this.

In conclusion, see a doctor (if you have not done so already).

Paul.

Homosexual Christians have indeed ""checked out"" these verses.  Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations.
Others simply do not address the issues.

You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spirit-led course

In a cell church, the fundamental building block is the ""cell group"" -- a
small group of no more than 15 believers.  The small groups are responsible
for the ministry of the church: evangelism and discipleship.  The emphasis
is on relationships, not on programs, and both the evangelism and the
discipling are relationship-based.

This will probably raise more questions than it answered, but that's it in
a nutshell.

But why do you characterize this as a ""flight of fancy"" or a ""fantasy""?
While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious
that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was
at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance
of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that
something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation
into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This
does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of
fancy or a fantasy.

Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also,
""extra-scientific"", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of
rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble
over what a ""surprising"" experiment is, what counts as ""surprising"", etc.
The same may be said about ""logical grounds"".  My point is that quite frequently
(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to
previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of
some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples
such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his ""sea of air""
hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) ""surprising""?
Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must
be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)
out of ""perfectly rational grounds""?  Well, there was a pretty successful and
well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.
The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty
at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it ""new""?  Well, one
could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new
domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you
like.

  Nut or not, he was clearly a liar.  He said he would surrender after
  local radio stations broadcast his message, but he didn't.  Then he
  said he would surrender after Passover, but he didn't.

This won't work if there is a checksum on the keys you don't know about.
Neither will registering a clipper chip and then substituting a
""counterfeit"" one if the serial number contains a checksum.

Chances are the government has thought of this, and ""just anyone"" won't be
permitted access to enough of the internals to make a ""fake"" clipper chip.
Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals
at a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security
safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.

While not perfect, it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing
chip, since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation.
Some of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here, for example, have
already got their heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little
chance of getting a clearance.

Of course it's not impossible that someone do this, but probably extremely
difficult. Chances are there will also be very heavy criminal penalties for
phony clipper chips, on some national security/classified info grounds or
other, thus making the game not worth the candle.

[If the original message claims that marriage is not discussed in the
Bible, I have to disagree.  Various aspects of marriage are discussed
in some of Paul's letters, Ephesians 5 sees marriage as a symbol of
God's relationship with the church.  If it means specifically that the
marriage ceremony isn't described, then that seems to be true.  But I
think what most people mean by Christian marriage is not so much that
it takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the various
commitments to each other that are associated with marriage in the
Bible.  --clh]

and

Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word ""apacgw,"" you will
find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent
reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I
recently checked several Lexicons:

	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida
	""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""
	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm
	""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale
	""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich
	""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" Perschbacher

A couple simply stated ""hanged oneself"", and a couple were more explicit 
and stated that ""apacgw"" means specifically ""kill yourself by hanging."" A
couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for ""apacgw"" is
""strangle, throttle or choke"" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who
suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best
references though, ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New
Testament,"" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the
literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also
other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give
further context).  

The word ""apagchw"" has two root words: ""gchw"" is the ""to strangle"" root, and
the root word ""apo"" means literally ""away."" This root words is included in
words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the
greek word ""apagello"" means to send a message).  ""Apo"" can also denote a
change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson
specifically makes comparison to the word ""apokteiuo,"" which means ""to kill.""
In literal meaning the word ""apacgw"" means ""to throttle, strangle to put out
of the way,"" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from
life, to death).  So while the word ""apacgw"" does mean ""to hang,"" it
specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he
state that it means ""to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging."" He then
notes the the use of ""apacgw"" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He
presents that example of ""apacgw"" as being used to explicitly mean ""suicide by
hanging."" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the
added denotation of ""death,"" and as you insist that the Bible was written by
God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete
meaning of ""apacgw"" (ie: Since the word ""apacgw"" was used, then death is
denoted as the result). 

By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of ""apacgw"":

> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),
> it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice

> died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.""   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
> ^^^^ 
> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel ""hanged himself"" [Gr. Sept.,
> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, ""and died"".  Here we have no doubt of the
> result.
> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.

Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to
Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie"" the the
Hebrew say ""and died""), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. 
It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added ""and died"", the
correct translation would still be ""apacgw,"" as the man did indeed die from
strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the
Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions
which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily
executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it
now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove
your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing
""apacgw"" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless
assertions without corresponding evidence. 

Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it
one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,
I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above
what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or
historical source to justify it. 

By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:

> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.

Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that
there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description
of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to
assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two
thousand years ago (after all, things change). 

Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same
as the 30 silvers:

> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather

> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and
> obtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry?
>          ^^^^^^

True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal
""an iniquity,"" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'
actions ""an iniquity"" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took
the money box, but rather said:

    ""Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling
     him ""Buy what we need for the feast""; or that he should give something
     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and
     it was night.""

Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money
box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose
the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different
book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by
the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. 

Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen
evidence that ""apacgw"" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was
successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because
Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:
Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself
the next day.  Thus the money which bought the ""Field of Blood"" would have to
have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver
that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I
believe that the house of cards is comming down). 

Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on
Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.

By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the
mention of it in Matthew), you say:

> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
> this with you.

I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we
are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping 
these issues.

    PS. I would note again, that you are not stating that that Bible
    is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *IS* inerrant.
    Since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely ""possible""
    reconciliations (I of course don't rate them that highly), then the 
    best you can do is say that the Bible is ""possibly"" inerrant, not that 
    it *is* inerrant.

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

Currently, my solution is:

	XCreateWindow(...);
	XSetWMProperties(..);
	XMapWindow(...);
	XFlush(...);
	XMoveWindow(...);


It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
if I'm overlooking something obvious.

I have the same problem and was about to post this....

Hello duo owners (and Apple technical people :-)
 
I have a new duo 230 which appears to have a problem waking up from
sleep when running on battery power. When woken (usually for the second
time) after sleeping, the wake fails and the screen appears with a
corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be
recovered with control-command-poweron or the reset key at the back of
the machine. The problem occurs even when the system is stock standard
(no extensions, no virtual memory, a fully charged new battery, system 7.1
etc). I have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to AC.
I've checked that the battery is properly seated (it appears to be fine).
 
What's going on here ? Anyone else had this problem ? Is it software or
hardware ? 
 
If you have a duo 230 and a bit of time, try repeatedly sleeping and
waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same
behaviour (and let Apple know too !).
 
Many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me.
 
Bruce

those work very well in stopping an attack?

MY HOCKEY EDUCATION?  What the f--- are you talking about?  I'm

""I hate the Habs"" ?...you sound like a 10-year old.  This
statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to
argue objectively about hockey.  Don't give me this crap about
""cogent arguments""...I've yet to read something of yours that is
cogent.  You consistently argue with: (1) emotion; (2) huge,
sweeping statements
 
Frankly, you have a very unconvincing style.
 
I'm not defending Bob Gainey...frankly, I don't care for him all
that much.  But your dismissal of him as something less than an
effective hockey player is tiresome...it has no basis in
anything.  How many Calders did he win? I think it was four (go
ahead and refresh my memory).  What about the Conn Smythe?  Was
that a fluke?  Yeah, not the makings of a hockey superstar, I

You seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into

Great.  I couldn't agree more.  The Flyers won two cups for the
same reasons...deservedly so.  So what?  I don't get it.  Are you
angry that the Leafs didn't get more recognition?  
 
You seem to think these pluggers are ""hyped""...I don't

I remember this happening on the I-75 through Michigan and Ohio several
years back. A group of guys in an old beater would rear end a car,
usually out of state or Canadians. You stop and they smack you with a BB
bat. At least they didn't kill you for the sake of a car.
I think the cops put out decoys and this calmed down for a while.

I am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here.   If  you
asked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if LA played in
the Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be?
What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  The
naming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary
obfuscation.

Hardly.  The ""established"" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.
The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team
could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did
was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-
olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-
er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly
debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-
bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people
played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe
and his pals showed up.

What's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better
defenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that
Bruce Norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby
Orr's  then,  in the interests of education, why don't you take a poll
and find out how many people know who Norris was?  But you don't  have
to, do you?

So you don't feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember
that  Vancouver  plays in the West division?  (Or Pacific, or whatever
other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen.)

And of course you neatly deleted Jason's  jingoistic  rant  about  the
game  losing  its  ""Canadianization"".   Quoting me out of context does
more to erode your credibility than it  does  mine.   My  position  is
clearly  progressive  and  is anything but ""biased, closed minded, ig-
norant"".  Arrogant, I will grant you.

Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System.  Unline Win3.1, it does not 
run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true 
multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1 
programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is
primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be
economical for most users.
	Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.  
It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's 
just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs, 
and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed 
on CD-ROM.

Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue 
multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements, 
and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably 
be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the 
main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.
	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense 
competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will 
arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the 
client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together, 
partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).  
(Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't
scorn the concept.)
	Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be 
released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out 
til '96.
	With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)

There is a number you can call which will return a synthesized
voice telling you the number of the line.  Unfortunately, for the
life of me I can't remember what it is. The telephone technicians
use it all the time.  We used to play around with this in our

You need to add two 256K VRAM SIMMs;  512K VRAM SIMMs will not work in any 
of the Quadra or Centris machines.  There is already 512K of VRAM soldered 
to the logic board.  You add the two 256K SIMMs to this to give you a

Herkesi fasist diye damgala sonra, kendileri fasistligin alasini yapinca,
""ac kaldilar da, yiyecekleri yok amcasi, bu seferlik affedin"" de. Yurrruuu, 
yuru de plaka numarani alalim......

As one who was born in Quebec and worked in Montreal, I feel I must
defend the reputation of McGill University. It is a fine, old,
creditable institution of higher learning.

Thus, I can only assume that some under graduate student left his/her
terminal on-line and the janitor has been getting access to it.

We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the
International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also
some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of
groups.  Sorry for the cross posting.

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines
(See the diff marks at the right hand edge).  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are
in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry 
about these changes.

XNOTE: Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->	      |
X
X
XRULES:
X
X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:
X
X    1) Your entry must be a complete program.
X
X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters
X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }
X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.
X
X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)
Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below)
Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)
Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below)
Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested
X	Use tab indented lines if needed
X---remark---
X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if
X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
X    column.  Blank lines are permitted.
X---author---
Xname:	your name
Xorg:	School/Company/Organization
Xaddr:	postal address
X	use tab indented lines to continue
X	don't forget to include the country
Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.
X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)
X---info---
XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
X---build---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program
Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
Xfile must be 255 bytes or less.
X---program---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.
X---end---
X
X      Regarding the above format:
X
X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*
X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.
X
X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
X
X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()
X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)
X
X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the
X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
X
X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above
X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges.
X
X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
X
X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and
X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
X
X	* The entry's remarks should include:
X	    - what this program does
X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)
X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any
X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
X	    - information about any ---data--- files
X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated
X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
X
X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
X
X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They
X	  should not be required to exist.
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple
X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe
X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
X	       digit, followed by '.c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title, possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
X
X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
X
X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
X
X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.
X
X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:
X
X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
X		obfuscate@toad.com
X
X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.
X
X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.
X
X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
X       must be sent in a separate Email letter.
X
X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.
X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.
X
X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
X       special owner or group) are not allowed.
X

X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Guidelines, Hints and Comments

XABOUT THIS FILE:
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
X
X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      |
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:
X
X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers
X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with
X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor
X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year.
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry:
X
X	* look at the original source
X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
X	* run it through a C beautifier
X	* examine the algorithm
X	* lint it
X	* compile it
X	* execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it.
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse.
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
X    working entry is best.
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:
X
X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
X
X	#define d define
X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo
X
X	int i;
X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k;
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you
X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in
X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |
X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |
X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      |
X
X	int i;
X	char *c;
X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead
X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
X    not portable and must not be used:
X
X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables
X	* using va_list as a structure or union
X
X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.
X
X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.
X
X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int.
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
X    programs that are compact, and are instructional.
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that:
X
X	* are very hardware specific
X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific
X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
X	      code is likely not to be)
X	* dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x
X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
X	* are longer than they need to be
X	* are similar to previous winners
X	* are identical to previous losers  :-)
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint.
X
X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
X
X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating
X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
X    know of a smaller one!
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).
X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or
X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better
X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
X    in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    We like programs that:
X
X	* are as concise and small as they need to be
X	* do something at least quasi-interesting
X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
X	* are portable
X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
X    areas really does help.
X
X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
X
X    Be creative!
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT:
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)
X
X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentry.c:
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts.
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
X
X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following:
X
X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
X
X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:
X
X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source
X		cp prog.c special_src.c
X		cc special_src.c -o special_name
X
X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build
X		tail +4 build > special_build
X		sh < special_build
X
X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of
X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You
X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
X    then skip the ---info--- section.
X
X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file.
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
X    the entry should not require them exist.
X
X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
X    say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
X    so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
X    have entry number 0.
X
X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the
X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:
X
X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
X
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer
X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as
X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:
X
X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many
X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:
X
X	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y""
X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X
X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced.
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS:
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:
X
X	---entry--- section
X	all ---author--- sections
X	all ---info--- sections
X	---build--- section
X	---program--- section
X	any other text, including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end, who won and where they were from.
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks)
X
X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions:
X
X	* reading the ---entry--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X
X    In later rounds, other actions are performed:
X
X	* linting the source
X	* compiling/building the source
X	* running the program
X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
X    An entry often will compete in several categories.
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive.  A typical category list might be:
X
X	* best small one line program
X	* best small program
X	* strangest/most creative source layout
X	* most useful obfuscated program
X	* best game that is obfuscated
X	* most creatively obfuscated program
X	* most deceptive C code
X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
X	* best abuse of ANSI C
X	* worst abuse of the rules
X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
X
X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
X    less clear cut.
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry
X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
X
X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way.
X
X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:
X
X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:
X
X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
X
X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc
X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
X    below for details.
X
X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners
X    have appeared in books (""The New Hackers Dictionary"") and on T-Shirts.
X
X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)

Then you must be living in an alternate universe. Where were they?

                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,
documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.

The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.

The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.

Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.
Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also
been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.
Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives 
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection 
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are
violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,
its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over 
the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States. 

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent 
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan.

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR.

We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we 
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000
Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the 
neighboring lands.

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.

But what about the lives of seven million human beings?
If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are
less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their 
colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other
attributes?

All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous
appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

                KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus
in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the
Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved
by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict
lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which
were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of
thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. 

Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred
thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and
Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims
at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole
thing has now gone entirely too far.

They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 
78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this 
time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the 
plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. 

Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992

                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED

     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today 
of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.
     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed
1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and 
massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered
mountain passes.
     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani
reports of a massacre.

                         Scalping Reported
     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them 
from retrieving more bodies.
     ""Women and children have been scalped,"" said Assad Faradshev, an aide
to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies,
they began firing at us.""
     The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: ""The bodies
are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this.""
                         
                         Truckloads of Bodies
     Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,
Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani
bodies.
     ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as
many in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their head cut off, and many had
been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

They require two separate grounds.  One ground goes to the ground pin
of the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's
mounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal
faceplate, if any).

The box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.
The outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated
busbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to
the building-entrance main ground by its own wire.

So the two separate ground systems are connected together at the
building's service entrance.  But one is also connected to every
grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,
while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged
into isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens
to accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,
the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it
until the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated
ground will remain relatively noise-free.

General question: Since the world was discovered to be
round, the definition of Saturday is, if not ambiguous,
at least arbitrary. How would someone answer this?

Also, when the calendar was changed (Gregorian to Julian?)
was the day of the week changed or just the date? Once again
this points to the arbitrariness of the days.

All of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said
that he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.
If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup
by now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim
and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent
enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.
But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM
so none of this is true anyway.

I just ordered a Saturn SL1 after considering a few imports. Frankly, the Saturn
way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new
car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by
most salespeople I met.

Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where
I bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales
support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what
I wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the
dealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on
what he's seen and heard from his customers. 

Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles, 
fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or
so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more
like $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any
warranty work, without counting against the refund.

	First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I
am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all,
although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science
has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence--
God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree,
Science.

	My problem with Science is that often it allows us to
assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us
with the ability to produce life through sexual relations,
for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone.
Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision
through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power
to decide who should and should not be able to have 
children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that
is made possible.

	People have always had the ability to end lives
unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives
into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially
created life is artificially created death, and as God
has reserved judgement about when people should die to
Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how
people should be brought in to the world.

	This is not to say that I reject all forms of
medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates
pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly
acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus
to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely 
prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary 
alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,  
go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God
gave us?

	I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I
would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not,
but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the
universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask
why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body
they have been given, they should ask themseles why their
body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot
make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but
I will say that each person should pray for guidance
when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and
should cease their unravelling if they have reason to 
believe their search is displeasing to God.

   Geez, where have you been, Ryan?  I proposed this theory *months*
ago.  Let's take it one step further, even.  If, as the surveys show,
up to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there must
be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic
fantasies.  But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we
say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated
gay potential.  Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or,
more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social
sanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.

   Obviously, Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category.

   These people are the ones who are so hung up on ""choice.""
Obviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals are
just flaunting their ""perversion"" by choosing not to go along with what
society has dictated.

   Of course, I'm that most awful of perverts.  I chose, I gleefully
admit that I was heterosexual until I met the right man and *chose* to
indulge in my homoerotic potential.  Take that!

Just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. Top three
contenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the
biggest ""cult following"", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it
because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any
tweaking.

The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are
backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in
effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two
modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables &
all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order
directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and
they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...

USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;
it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable
and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model
from PC outlets for $190.

All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a
Motorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how
it works in two weeks or so.

  While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their
relief staff may be suspect.  They don't have a real closer -- although
Mike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  Didn't Stanton start off
great last year and then falter?  Despite this, your point is well taken.
Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is 
unlikely to self-destruct.  For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to
suffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.

  From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the
club.  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success.  He must have
another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West.

      Right!  A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling

      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
      club so far.  Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting
      on base.  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man, Bagwell has had to
      assume Biggio and Finley's job.  Biggio concerns me, since he usually
      starts the season very strong.

     On a side note, are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next year's uniform?  There is talk that their road uniform will be
(blech..) traditional grey, with the word ""HOUSTON"" written across the
chest.  If I'm not mistaken, their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange (shiver..).  McLane's favorite color is red, so...
     I'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible.  I'd like to see the uniform of the mid-1980s return.  They
may not have been pretty, but Houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball -- and I liked it.

assuming yours is a non turbo MR2, the gruffness is characteristic of
a large inline 4 that doesn't have balance shafts.  i guess toyota

myself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration (or

balance shafts..  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you

if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do

And I recommend the movie _The Thin Blue Line_, which is about the
same case.  Not as much legal detail, but still an excellent film.  It
shows how very easy it is to come up with seemingly conclusive
evidence against someone whom you think is guilty.

That is not necessarily unorthodox.  When Christians call God 'Father', 
we are using a metaphor.  The Bible in one place refers to God as being
like a mother.  God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal
sense; God has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is
usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less
misleading of the two possibilities.

But the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips
you can get - an Alpha is WAY slow at 66 MHz, but blazes at
200 MHz.

>>680040
>>486

>As far as the 486DX2-66 goes - 32 SPECint92, 16 SPECfp92 .

But the 68040 is (or will soon be) available in 40 MHz version,
making it ""comparable"" to a 486DX2-80

I think you have that one turned around; they have faster clock
cycles but less power behind each cycle. Not to mention that the
Intel instruction stream is BYTE-oriented (longest Intel instruction
is 15 bytes; what an odd number :-) which makes it hard to do any
intelligent memory subsystem.

You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in
front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).
My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.

Good UV (""blacklight"") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.  I'd proceed by
getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an
electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it.

Source: Edward K. Boghosian, ""Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity
Meeting,"" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.

ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,
including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both
Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the 
Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new
Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during
the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And
judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these
political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian
Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.

The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of
the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed
by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the
armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia
(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern
countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to
have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks
of ASALA...

Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian
people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of
the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal...
Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement 
was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam 
Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued 
support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, 
pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be 
open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. 
Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that 
his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that
this policy will continue. ""The doors of our camps are always open to 
Armenian freedom fighters,"" he affirmed.

Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son
of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;
two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the
specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of
the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist
party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,
a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the
European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among
those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow
the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.

More than significant was the large number of messages received by the 
organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary
Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation
Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist
Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other
international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.

                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM

Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary
Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction
and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to
foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the
Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will
continue to ""reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,""
to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag ""Bureau.""
The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that
exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,
open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.

The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the
Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.
The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have
turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who
prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
              
     
 
> 
>It is not possible that [(*]'s text has 287 pages, mine has 353, and yours has
>377!
 
 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
 not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

   Here are some books I have read recently that helped me not only
   prepare for a 5 week series I taught in Sunday School, but greatly
   increased my knowledge of the Qumran scrolls. [...]

One other recent book I would heartily recommend is Joseph Fitzmyer's
_Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls_ (Paulist,
1992).

Fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern NT scholars.  He was also one
of the early workers on the DSS.  His book is written in a
straightforward Q&A that allows it to serve as a source for a great
wealth of clearly presented basic, up-to-the-moment information about
the DSS.

(This book is something of a companion volume to Raymond Brown's
_Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls_.)

How hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular

Why didn't you create 8 grey-level images, and display them for
1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128... time slices?

This requires the same total exposure time, and the same precision in

=============================================================
Hi Folks;

Thursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy
U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.

The short version is that his testimony was consistent with
the opening statements for the prosecution.

Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)
on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation
with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was
using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up
into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an
observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies
Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to
scout further possible surveillance sites.

Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into
a gully to see, ""whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.""
Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking
loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.

They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the
""fern field""] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin
Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance
team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should
take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy
target and might be ""shot in the back.""

As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the
road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.

At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to ""fend
him off with his gun.""  [It is unclear whether this means he
clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then
took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and
Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not
noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan
got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, ""Stop!  U.S.
Marshal!""  Harris then ""...brought the weapon around at hip level
and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw
Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.""  Cooper fired
at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon
to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then
heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the
direction of the shots, yelled, ""You son of a bitch!"" and ran
toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him
from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the
cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward
the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two
fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and
then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the
other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large
burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.

On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of
throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, ""You wanted to lure that
dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?""  Nevin also
pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had
claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.
Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and
decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the
cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an
armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at
him [no answer was available].

Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.

Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.

When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run
Speedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs.  Both machines were running
System7.1, had a 14"" RGB.  Don't know what the caches were set to.
Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a
bit faster than the LC III:

		Centris610		LCIII

CPU		13.01			6.92
Graf		15.67			7.69
Disk		2.22			2.44
Math		25.57			10.19

P.R. Rating	12.91			6.58

So, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed
difference between these two machines according to Speedometer3.1.

Subject: outlining of spline surface
Keywords: spline rasterization
Lines: 38


	About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to
be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if
anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published 
solutions to it.

	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two
roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially
starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the 
edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant
between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw 
the object we 

1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively
	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the
        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume
	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not
	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable
	measure.
2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment
	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two
	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.
3) Depth sort the triangles
4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw
	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is
	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge
	colored with a special ""edge color""

	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the
problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.
The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in
the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.
They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting
from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem
sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this
area.

Yes, however, with the top off and the rear window down this car is more

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?
You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they
exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?

Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone
know how they perform?

Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive
controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?
What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?

The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card
(or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc
or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions
of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to
come down in price.

I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented
data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when
managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.

I like my Wrangler, but when doing some serious off roading, it can't
keep up with a CJ-5 because of ground clearance and limited suspension

Hi,

In Canada, any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed (I think it's a
small metal tag that's placed over the trigger).  The net result of this is
that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the
National Parks.  Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances
of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.

I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer
to Nature, that they are a part of Nature and, as such, have to deal with
nature on it's own terms.

I wouldn't bet on it.

Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and
their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home.
They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control
because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The
Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan
liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands
per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of
Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming
public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects
criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to
even the most brutal Arab tyrants.

Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans
have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan,
Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.

You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I
suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with
Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less.

As far as I know ISDN (call it Swissnet here, and it's being plugged in) it's
8 bit 8000Hz (gives you one channel of 64kBit/sec) I guess you should not go
below a sampling rate of 6000 Hz if you want to have same quality as on an

Good statement! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact
social morals? Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient
religious doctrines? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single
denominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute

I'd be willing to make two wagers:
1) Snow doesn't win ROY.
2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.

I'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a
player, and he is on a losing team.

I'm skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this
year, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and
most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.

Could be wrong on either or both, but I think that's the smart way to
bet...

I'm confused.  How is it Hal McRae's fault that he can't win with a team 
whose best offensive player is Phil Hiatt?  I mean, let's be real.  Kansas
City will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end

Here is what I am looking for:

* - John Ankerberg's recent series ""Understanding Homosexuality and

* - James Kennedy's special on homosexuality which aired this week,
and the portion of the previous week's program which discussed ""The
Gay Agenda.""

I will not pay money for copies, since this is copyrighted material
and that would be illegal.  I will pay for return postage.  If
somebody can think of something they would desire in trade, please let
me know and I'll see what I can do.

Oh, BTW, I'm watching the March On Washington right now on C-SPAN. 
Other than the fact that I'm generally repulsed by what I'm watching,
I found one thing of interest.  General David Dinkins just finished
speaking, and remarked that the New York City delegation consists of
about 200,000 people.  Funny, I don't see 200,000 people out there,

True, all you need to define is one statement that defined one

I think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the
SIGNIFICANT amount of disk access that Windows does on startup.  It's like
it's trying to it's bit in wearing the damn drive out.  I estimate it's only
reading a Mb of programs & data, but from the performance the drive gives, it
sounds like they are scattered all over the drive (my drive is however
regularily compressed).  What is it that takes so much fuss.  Perhaps if MS

I don't have to make outrageous claims about religion's affecting and

that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate
atheism. At no time have I made any statement that religion was the
sole cause of anything, what I have done is point out that those who

To credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to

history. I believe that those who distort history in this way know

DC-X as is today isn't suitable for this. However, the followon SDIO
funds will. A reusable sounding rocket was always SDIO's goal.

So did I. There is a lot going on now and some reports are due soon 
which should be very favorable. The insiders have been very bush briefing
the right people and it is now paying off.

However, public support is STILL critical. In politics you need to keep
constant pressure on elected officials.

Let's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd
take Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1
netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than
that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records
are similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as
the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.

You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well
be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in
those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,
the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.

But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play
for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just
my opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that
about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm
batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.

As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the
offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the
save.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't
get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's
what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the
shooter to beat him.

> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie

I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on
opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending
champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was
senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a
Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game
and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are
part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.

Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and
I'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current
7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I
don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any
tickets next season:-).

Sure.  Contact the World Space Foundation.  They're listed in the sci.space
Frequently Asked Questions file, which I'll excerpt.

    WORLD SPACE FOUNDATION - has been designing and building a solar-sail
    spacecraft for longer than any similar group; many JPL employees lend
    their talents to this project. WSF also provides partial funding for the
    Palomar Sky Survey, an extremely successful search for near-Earth
    asteroids. Publishes *Foundation News* and *Foundation Astronautics
    Notebook*, each a quarterly 4-8 page newsletter. Contributing Associate,
    minimum of $15/year (but more money always welcome to support projects).

	World Space Foundation
	Post Office Box Y
	South Pasadena, California 91301

WSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and
nonfiction about solar sails: *Project Solar Sail*.  I think Robert
Staehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,
a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh),
and I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something
to say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as
quite a few references.


Check the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society*:

V36 p. 201-209 (1983)
V36 p. 483-489 (1983)
V37 p. 135-141 (1984)
V37 p. 491-494 (1984)
V38 p. 113-119 (1984)
V38 p. 133-136 (1984)

(Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of
reprints? I just found the file.)

And K. Eric Drexler's paper ""High Performance Solar Sails and Related
Reflecting Devices,"" AIAA paper 79-1418, probably in a book called
*Space Manufacturing*, maybe the proceedings of the Second (?)
Conference on Space Manufacturing.  The 1979 one, at any rate.

Submarines, flying boats, robots, talking         Bill Higgins

I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.

The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If
Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold
at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than
Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double.)

Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No
team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players
than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 1950's for all teams.  

Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon
Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with
38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by Runs Created.

No. I estimate a 99 % probability the Gehrels referred to

Maybe in the 24th century they could do gamma ray spectroscopy on

Subject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 1: Goaltenders
Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 80

As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,
trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through
for the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will
have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can
kill them.

I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,
are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as
possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks
and/or did not play for another NHL team this season.

Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...

#1	BRIAN HAYWARD		Season:	11th
Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		P (D)

It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that
featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and
'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing
grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this
year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would
not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.

But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first
ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.
As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.

#30	JEFF HACKETT		Season: 3rd
Acquired:	'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft
Grade:		C

Hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply
wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,
almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save
percentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to
bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry
the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early
injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,
but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next
year.

#31	WADE FLAHERTY		Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie)
Acquired:	'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent
Grade:		I (A-)

It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the
incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary
Flames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started
the season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'
owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP
honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he
tries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs
Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up
all-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can
share the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor
Robins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he
may not ever.

#32	ARTURS IRBE		Season:	1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B+

I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that
he's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has
provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting
the team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.
He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and
making passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the
goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do
with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for
a playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named
as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.

The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).
 And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is
just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the
inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to
grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are
doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it
must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to
the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is
possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the
eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts
now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing
people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and
Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His
plan might be accomplished.
    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to
execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to
fulfill the chorus of ""Let his blood be upon our hands"" of the crowd in
Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,
which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish
other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. 
Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, ""Mene, mene,
tekel, peres?""  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's
justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians
as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the
extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. 
The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and
the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go
on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is
quite clear.
Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to
question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,
He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans
9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of
Jesus Christ is as follows: ""Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand.""  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - ""Let
the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.""  There is not an infinite
amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to
follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, ""well, alright,
you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your
plans.""  He said ""Follow me.""  His message is NOT ""I'm just a sweety-pie
who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and
Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.""  ""Our great God and Savior""
Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the
world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be
questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any
macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came
with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in
another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.
 
First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum
quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them
was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a
problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for
over two months.

The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal
hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just
splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard
connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare
cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found
in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly
soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of
shorts or bad connections.

Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk
ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what
I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another
male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,
and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a
crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not
damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.

Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for
power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this
day. 

In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of
the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are
intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it
seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal
should be terminated at all the ends.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

MK48T02 from thomsom.  It has a timekeeper (clock) and 512 bytes of NVRAM which
has a lithium battery backup.  The battery has a life of ~10 years of poweroff
operation.  Installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not
draw much current.  The battery would only be used when your auto battery was
dead or had been removed.

In California they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which states
that the odometer mileage is correct.  If incorrect you are required to 
fill in what you know (or guesstimate) to be the correct mileage.  If you
lie on this form and are caught you can be prosecuted and the buyer can
sue you for the value of the mileage differential.

The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting
ground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big NO NO), and you are talking
about them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be).

If this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current
flow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the
house are operating.  There should not be any flow in the ground wires
unless there is a fault condition.  Notice also that in the breaker box
there is a wire leading from the above-mentioned junction to earth ground,
usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground.

If you only do read/print then there is no reason for the joystick stuff
not to take 90% of the time even if it is efficient.

The truth is that int 15H joystick reading IS slow. I read it directly
from the hardware port. Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent
disturbance from interrupts, so you may want to read (say) twice in a
row and keep the lower results. Don't just turn interrupts off, it may
prove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other
devices.

Here is an example of how to do this:

/* ------------------------------ joy.c ------------------------------------- */

/* An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port

 * Uses inp()/outp() for byte port access.
 * Will timeout when 'int count=0' counts up to zero.
 * This sample reads one port (A is presented and B is in the comments).
 * You can read both at once by merging the two, but it will time out
 * when either joystick is not connected.
 *
 * There is no need to optimize this routine since it runs for as long as
 * the joystick circuitry needs.

Honda:  a ""V"" designates a V engine street bike. ""VF"" for V-4, ""VT"" for V-twin.
""CB"" is a street bike with an parallel twin or inline 4-cylinder engine.
""R"" used to mean race bike, but is now also used to mean sport bike.

Via K_P, of course.  Nothing was said about where K_P comes from.  It's
the session key, though, and it's chosen however you usually choose
session keys --- exponential key exchange, shared secret, RSA, etc.
But however you choose it, the chip will apparently emit the escrow

Keywords: Mac IIcx, internal, hard disk drive, SCSI

Yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally. This
is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the
stock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI 
accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,
New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.

I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive
tower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto
which I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally
terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems
occur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two
internal hard drives.

It works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.

Considering that Clinton received a draft notice and got out of it (he admits it) the political feasibility of him abolishing it is not something he would

If you read Aviation Week, the C-5 line can be reopened and the C-5s
would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the

Agreed. Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf.
The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there
is a lack of ASW foes to contend with. The Navy is considering reducing
the number of attack subs to 40 (Navy Times) and that would entail
getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class.

Politically, General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get
Seawolf subs whether we need them or not.

In addition, more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station
and others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being 
required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships.

The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down
a pork happy Congress.

Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card

Several problems:

1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB
   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED
   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K
   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB
   VRAM.

2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:

   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an
      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often
      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to
      be.

   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the
      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you
      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).

3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development
   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger
   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the
   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed
   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The
   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.

   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen
   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter
   ""R"". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it
   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.

   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive
   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with
   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles
   the VGA mode.
   
   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use
   another monitor in place of my usual one.

I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be
remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).

Very simple.

After all, your criminal grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim

You must be a new Armenian clown. You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF 
crooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in 
such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has 
already been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer 
and hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible 
for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian 
and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government 
as merely a step on the road to said genocide.

 Differences in the number of pages?

 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year

 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,
women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and 
those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

Not a chance.

And some people thought that I am exaggerating when claiming that the
Cripple Chip is just a first step in a totalitarian plot against the
civil liberties in the USA... It seems that I've even been an optimist
- the things are happening even faster than I expected.... That's
another of the dirty tricks they used to apply on us under the
communist regime - do something secret, THEN tell the people about is
(after the fact, when nothing can be done any more), and of course,
explaining them how much better the situation is now...

In my previous messages I wrote that the Americans should wake up and
fight against the new proposal. Now it seems to me that it is already
too late - it has already happened, the civil liberties have been
violated, no, stollen from the American people, while the most part of
this people has been sleeping happily... :-((( Too sad...

Tom's right about this.  It's only a grantable right if the granter has
the will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you.
Never mind the legal status.

Nick's right about this.  It's always easier to obtain forgiveness than
permission.  Not many people remember that Britain's King George III
expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany/appalachian
mountains.  Said subjects basically said, ""Stop us if you can.""  He
couldn't.

That's how the USA started.  Of course, that's also how the Bolivarian
Republic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  It didn't have
quite the staying power of the USA.  I'm sure there are more examples of
going far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right
now.

Or do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want to
carry out as ""scientific research"" which just coincidentally requires
the recovery of megatonnes of minerals (or whatever), then go at it.

Lute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya (I think) in
the late '70's for his commercial space launch project (one of the very
earliest).  It was killed by Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise
missiles in Africa, which made Libya renege on the arrangement.

Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are
completely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).

Great, you can compare two numbers (ATA has several speed modes, by the
way) but what the article said was misleading/wrong.

Something is missing there. :) Anyway, I agree. There's a lot of
opportunity for marketing jingo like ""SCSI-2 compliant"" which tells
you nothing about the performance, whether it has ""WIDE"" support, etc.

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would
have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on
homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one
cannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a
correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.

Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive
gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in,
would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from
someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?  That is one
problem with surveys.  Nobody will answer an incriminating question.
Another is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to
here.

Does that mean no Vancouver citizens have handguns? I think not. You
are discounting guns purchased beforehand, and guns purchased for
purposes other than self-defense, which can also be used for defense.

He makes valid points about demographic differences.  You then resort
to the kind of argument that the ""Politically Correct"" movement often
uses to stifle any debate.  Nice, real nice.

One doesn't have to produce his own data in order to point out the
flaws in the methodology and conclusions of another's study. Again,
you resort to PC tactics.

   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling
himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first
in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term
but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations
are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the
eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar
Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the
Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is
synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who
originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans
and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word
by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is
nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim
to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-
shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.

  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In
search of the Indo-Europeans"" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.
The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature
as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and
for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible
things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have
no clear claim.

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society
accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when
an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should
work to convince others.

And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered
the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept
the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely
going to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of
what risk is acceptable.  It is much more likely that an innocent person
will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.

I found this press release from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice on
another system, and thought it would be of interest on campuses 
where the administration or the athletics department wants to 
eliminate the women's ice hockey team.

 Women Athletes, TLP Win Sex Discrimination Ruling: Brown University
Ordered to Restore Two Women's Varsity Teams
To: National Desk, Sports Writer
 Contact: Lynette Labinger, 401-421-9794, home 401-274-7507, or
          Ray Marcaccio, 401-831-8900, both of Trial Lawyers For
          Public Justice

   WASHINGTON, April 16 -- The U.S. Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit in Boston has upheld a U.S. District Court
order requiring Brown University to immediately reinstate its women's
gymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status. The ruling in
Cohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision
in the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial
Lawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest
law firm representing the women athletes.
   ""This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a
school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of
opportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,""
said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.
   The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that
prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions
receiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as
university-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to
compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for
uniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also
been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.
   ""This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,""
said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &
Labinger.  ""Universities across America need to reevaluate their
programs quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced.""
   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State
University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and Colgate
University are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders
requiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity
teams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is
representing women athletes at IUP.
   In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included:
Ray Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca
& Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  The
National Women's Law Center, Women's Sports Foundation, and National
Association for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in
support of TLPJ's appeal.

BUT... If you are in the habit of trying to repair old and obsolete
machines, the old data books are a goldmine of information you can
not get anywhere else. If you are trying to find a modern replacement
for an obsolete part, the original specs really come in handy. Design
out of the new books but save the old ones (or donate them to a ham).

If anybody in Phoenix disagrees, I'll drive over and help them 'get rid'
of all their old data books.

though (ISDN 64K) is costly and the bandwidth limited.  That's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it.

Hmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all?  Are you
running any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ?  What sort of 
packets go blazing through? What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?).
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points?

What do you mean by network things?  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these 
images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.

The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack  
against DES is quite feasible now. But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB  
mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. Questions:

 - Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key? Then we have  
a 56 + 64 = 120 bit key.
 
 - If yes: Is anything known about the security of this key scheme? Can we  
break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space?

I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the ""Yeast Connection""
that there is indeed work by researchers to do this.  Of course, they are
working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus
membrane tissue with associated ""mild"" inflammatory response can and does
occur in a large number of people.  If you reject this ""yeast hypothesis"",
then I'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic
endeavor.  Stay tuned.

Seems he didn't understand anything about realities, liar, lunatic

Sigh, it seems religion makes your mind/brain filter out anything

So anyone that thinks the possibilities with Jesus is bound to the

We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on  
Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent  
Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to  
encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our  
three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  
that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.


On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  
will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  
awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.

Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  
characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  
trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  
lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   
Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  
last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  
lifetime.  

Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  
of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  
Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  
support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  
newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  
in the prevention, cure, and treatment.

Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  
those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  
were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  
attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  
Foundation's mission is to change that. 

Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  
Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  
Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  
Princeton, or sent directly to:

			The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation

Maybe I'm a little tired but I can't seem to follow the logic here. If 
whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest
(RC only apparently) is required. 

In fact if I read the next verse correctly (Matthew 18:19) I understand that
for a marriage to take place only two are required to agree on earth touching
one thing and it shall be done.

[Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any completely precise
statements about what is needed.  (As usual, the current edition of
the Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the
priest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be
required.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid
any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The
community provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are
involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of
their commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public
commitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular
marriage.  Where I'm not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in
exceptional cases (""valid but irregular"").  Ne Temere (1907) says that
no marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according
to the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new
canon law retains this, but I'd rather see a more recent and
authoritative source.  Note that while a Catholic priest is required
for Catholics, the Catholic church does recognize marriage between
baptized non-Catholics as valid without a priest.  --clh]

53 seconds to hash 20M of core (I bet I know who the source of your
information is!). No, it's not acceptable if it's part of your login
process. But if you are going to use network traffic as the source of
pseudo-random information, do the right thing and pass it through a
cryptographic hash function, not a compressor. Aside from the fact
that it will run faster, it will give better results (think of a
cryptographic hash as a function that ""distills"" randomness).
Something along the lines of 
	etherfind -t -x -n  | dd bs=1k count=10 2>/dev/null | md5
should do the trick. -t gives you timestamps, and the lack of -u makes
sure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten K. The above
takes a couple of seconds on a lightly-loaded ethernet.

Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source
at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and
how concerned you are about compliance with the general
interface and items like traversal.

   One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have
   already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be
   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.
   Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?

I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something
which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing
several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that
manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't
be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this
as an alternative.

   Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they
   could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!
   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not
   yet have the spec)?

Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you
looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD 
widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list
you could port.

And the two simplest refutations are these:

(1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament.
I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that
the recorded ""impact"" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other
contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain
being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection
is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years
after the supposed event.

(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no
one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).
Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one
gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make
up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does
record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really
guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.

And I suppose I should just take your word for it. Did you ever
think that many people who use firearms to protect themselves
might not admit to it because of the ridiculous laws which exist
forbidding concealed carry?

I already own a cool jacket. I ride a bicycle to work and park
it behind my desk. And if my woman decides to go with someone
else, I'd be disappointed but killing her new suitor will probably
not endear her to me any more than before. Frankly, I've never
met a woman worth killing for anyway. (Now, an AR-15 with a chrome

Does this pinhead know something the rest of us don't?
I'm not too worried about federal martials coming to get my guns.
The government can't seem to keep violent criminals in jail since
they don't have enough prison space, and the legal system is over-
burdened anyway. Where are they going to put all the millions of
gun-owners who won't fork over their weapons? Maybe you'd like to
volunteer the services of your humble abode, since you obviously

Not at all. Two weeks ago I registered a concern about some programming
that was being conducted by a student organisation here at the
University of Texas at San Antonio.  As a result, I was interrogated
by the capus police, who also attempted to create a positive-identification
file (photo, fingerprints, etc.). I refused to permit this, and filed a
complaint with the University administration.  The Vice-President for
Business Affairs (the 'boss' of the campus police) stated that he had no
interest in the legal/Constitutional implications of those actions.

   CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the
   massacres there including Deir Yassen,
   though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are 
   greatly minimized.

As per request of Hasan:

From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:

[pp. 225-227]

    ""Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the
story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized
throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had
four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting
was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated
throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,
children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their
stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy
was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties.

    ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in
accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am
convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].

    ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.
Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise
ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal
superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of
'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'

    ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the
result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.
Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the
Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.
Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main
road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the
Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the
rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even
before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir
Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir
Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the
conquest of Haifa.""


[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the loss
of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at
Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by
Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish
officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this
Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced
to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of
evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at
the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen
battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie
is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.""

I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on
the subject. I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by
ESPN, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked Stanky if he was
Jewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more
Jewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, ""I'm Polish, not Jewish.""

So maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was
a little naive when I posted it. I think we should just devote this
subject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers (I myself am Jewish and the
only ones I ever knew until now were Koufax, Greenberg, and Blomberg).

For a good discussion of cryptographically ""good"" random number
generators, check out the draft-ietf-security-randomness-00.txt
Internet Draft, available at your local friendly internet drafts
repository. 

A reasonably source of randomness is the output of a cryptographic
hash function (e.g., MD5), when fed with a large amount of
more-or-less random data. For example, running MD5 on /dev/mem is a
slow, but random enough, source of random bits; there are bound to be
128 bits of entropy in the tens (or hundreds) of megabytes of data in
a modern workstation's memory, as a fair amount of them are system
timers, i/o buffers, etc.

Aryans who do not base their reasoning on Nazi ideology are racists...

Thus spoke an American citizen in the name of Judaism. If this is Judaism,
I think Judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerous
philosophy.

I suspect however that Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other Jewish
scholars would have rather converted to Christianity than stay Jews, if
they would have perceived Judaism as such a perverted philosophy.

Those who wish to learn something about the perversion of Judaism,
should consult the masterly work by Yehoshua Harkabi, who was many
years the head of Israeli Intelligence and an opponent of the PLO. His
latest book was published in English and includes a very detailed analysis
of Judeo-Nazism.

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 (""ruggedized"") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a 
lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would
spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.
   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

I had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in
first and second grade (69-70, 70-71).  They came in Chocolate,
strawberry, and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long
and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well, it seemed
like space foil at the time).  

The taste is hard to describe, although I remember it fondly.  It was
most certainly more ""candy"" than say a modern ""Power Bar.""  Sort of
a toffee injected with vitamins.  The chocolate Power Bar is a rough

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis.  
Previously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice has
now changed.  Also, there will be differences in advice in patients with
and without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will be 
important.  I find the dietician very important in my practice, and 
I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing
them, since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories
and evaluate the contents of a diet than I do.

My own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom
is a good thing.

However, when I here people assert that the only ""true"" freedom
is in following the words of this and that Messiah, I realise
that people don't even agree on the meaning of the word.

What does it mean to say that word X represents an objective

Ok, here's the solution to your problem.  Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able
to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC), 
BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if
each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd
consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).

I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE
and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two
afternoon games.

Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed
to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore
and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.

The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that
""the people"" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and
have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.

I quote:

  ""... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in
  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the
  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the
  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people
  to keep and bear Arms ....""
	- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).

Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution
for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not
presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the
government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that
the amendment protected the individual right to possess military
weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully
gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the
interpretation.

Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:

 ""The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,
  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the
  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major
  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-
  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right
  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.""
   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the
     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,
     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )

You might rightfully ask ""well then, what does that first bit about
militias mean?""

Well, ""militia"" in historical context basically means the whole of the
adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines
""militia"" as all armed men over the age of 17).

   ""The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting
    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were
    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of
    the kind in common use at the time.""
	- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).

The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale
behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to
bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military
power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the
government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than
the other way around.

   ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason
   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last
   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.""
     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776
       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).

   ""And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of
   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be
   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.""
     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in
       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).

   ""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;
   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme
   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;
   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute
   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on
   any pretense, raised in the United States.""
     - Noah Webster, ""An Examination into the Leading Principles
       of the Federal Constitution"" (1787), in Pamphlets on the
       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).

You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be
repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it
doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have
changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine
it away.

I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.

However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get
it out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it in
talk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with
you.

No matter how ""absurd"" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by
mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common
moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of
any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a
workable moral system created for everyday use.

The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing
every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of
Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial
Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance
of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.

It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-
Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from
the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well
be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to
follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was
written down by man.

This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the
divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many
different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the
fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do
that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an
agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit
society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take
the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create
and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables
the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers
have done).

Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I
think the important aspect is the result.

My impression is that *for advanced work* you will be much better off with
German reference works (lexicons, concordances especially).  For a first-time
encounter, my *personal* preference would be to deal with a textbook written in
my native language.  But if you know German and are in Germany, pick up all the
reference books you think you can handle.  (I only know these works by
reputation, since my German is most rusty, but I'd look at the following books:
Koehler's lexicon, Mandeldern's concordance, the Jenni & Westermann theological
dictionary of the OT.)

The amount of language instruction available at US seminaries varies widely,
mostly depending on the denominational heritage of the school.  Presbyterian
and Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical
languages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoral
program in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  But
there are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the
attitude seems to be more, ""Well, if you're *really* interested we'll give you
a semester-long course, but we don't understand why . . ."")

The pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-year
students to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in each
language, followed by semester-long exegesis courses.  (That is: Hebrew in
August, OT exegesis in the fall; Greek in January, NT exegesis in the spring.) 
These courses are required for graduation, a third or a half of the students,
I'd say, take advanced biblical work that requires language work.

I'm not a redneck but . . . try a walk in their shoes first.  Stereotypes

self-righteous ""open minded"" new age lovers of the great planet Earth
as I have ignorant ""red necks"".  I don't see a correlation. I don't
believe that the ""redneck"" culture, if you can call it that, is
necessarily inferior or superior to any other.

Brad,
   For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality.  The only way 
to get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The 
""gain"" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred 
direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.

Yes, but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize
Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think
the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their
beliefs.

And actually, I think that the government already does recognize that
Christianity is the dominant religion in this country.  I mean, it is.
Don't you realize/recognize this?

This isn't to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of

No, but I hear quite a bit about Christmas, and little if anything about
Jesus.  Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really
associated to a high degree with him?  Or are you saying that the
association with Jesus is on a personal level, and that everyone thinks
about it but just never talks about it?

That is, can *you* prove that most people *do* associate Christmas
most importantly with Jesus?

I think the numbers *do* matter.  It takes a majority, or at least a

Subject: Mary's assumption
Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA
Lines: 34

A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on
earth:

One piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact
that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was
buried. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final
resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever
claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?
Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.

Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of
Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation
that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned
in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other
interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.

The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to
Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the
requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we
are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his
mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he
took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to
allow her flesh to rot in the grave.

One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine
on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary
did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.
The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying
whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic
theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make
sense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the
cross, would want to share in his death.

This suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds.  Years ago in another
time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive
engines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under
the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various
floation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd
spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.

So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out
the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed
to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the
outlet side that you put into any convenient container.  I'm sure these
gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.

 The balls are used to reduce the amplitude of oscillations of the wire during

What interpretations?  Just read it as it's written.
   ""A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free

Where does it say ""The right of the people to be members of a militia shall

not be infringed?""  NOWHERE.


""Well-educated businessmen being necessary to the ability of the nation to

Would you ""interpret"" this to mean that only businessmen should have a

What's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps ?

March '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about
dimming 120VAC lamps, but it seems to lead into phase-
control as the best method for controlling brightness.
  I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzing
filaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had
heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by
cycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp's
power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, then
nothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone has
tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using. Any
advice is appreciated!

Good heavens, you mean my good friend Wes Collins, who took his wife and two 
small children into the jungles of Guatemala, despite dangers from primitive 
conditions and armed guerillas, so that the indigenous people groups their 
could have the Bible in their native languages--the young man who led Bible 
studies in our church, who daily demonstrated and declared his deep abiding 
faith in the Lord of Love--you mean he really was a sneaky imperialistic *SPY* 
whose _real_ reason for going was to exploit and oppress the ignorant and 
unsuspecting masses?  Imagine my surprise!  I never would have thought it of 
him.

How was this terrible deceit discovered?  What exactly was the ""cultural 
interference"" they were caught committing?  Attempting to persuade the locals 
that their ancestral gods were false gods, and their sacrifices (including 
human sacrifices in some cases) were vain?  Destroying traditional lifestyles 
by introducing steel tools, medical vaccines, and durable clothes?  Oh and by 
the way, who did the denouncing?

I am terribly shocked to hear that my friend Wes, who seemed so nice, was 
really such a deceitful tool of the devil.  Please provide me with specific 
documentation on this charge.  There is some risk that I may not believe it 
otherwise.

You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, ""The
Hungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food,"" by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source
is a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with
ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air
to flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are
spaced every 6"" starting about 10"" above the bulb.

Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use
your oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may
not have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or
racks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my
oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a
wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close
the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows
for airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it
often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are
using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway
through.

If you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub
for this stuff.

I don't sign any blank checks.

When Doug Foxvog says ""weapons of mass destruction,"" he means CBW and
nukes.  When Sarah Brady says ""weapons of mass destruction"" she means
Street Sweeper shotguns and semi-automatic SKS rifles.  When John
Lawrence Rutledge says ""weapons of mass destruction,"" and then immediately
follows it with:

> this number can easily be reduced by putting reasonable restrictions
> on them.

...what does Rutledge mean by the term?

I have been playing with my Centris 610 for almost a week now.  I must say
this machine is really fast!  The hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but
I got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm.

However, I still have a few complaints:
- when I restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop
  pattern) jerks up and down for a few times.
- the Quantum 170 drive is noisy

Overall, I highly recommend it:  it is fast, affordable and looks great!

Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to
(usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  No
motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call
failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use
""slower"" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to
accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that
slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the
slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.

Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine
it has faster RAM.  

Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus 
slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

Maybe its a monitor problem.  You mentioned that you swapped cards, but not

 Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just ""Hey, how's it going, 
nice to meet you on the road, have a good ride""
 
 1) If you're watching for other bikes to wave to, it means your attention 
is on the road, where it should be, and you're more likely to see cages.
 
 2) It keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when 
you're IN a cage. This is a Good Thing.

On a similar note, has anyone found out a way to do this with MS FoxPro for
Windows? My setup.ini file was modified on disk 1 (all encrypted).. Well,
of course I forgot about Microsoft's stupid arrangement when I got the 
software, and used my name (it was paid for by the company I'm doing 
consulting for. When my job is done, it's their software).. Any ideas before
I start doing dumb things to a copy of that file??

Mattias
ps NO - I don't want to pirate this software. I just want to avoid having
to buy a new copy in order to change the registration information and then
having a copy lying around I don't use...

maybe I can get a new disk 1...

Hi there,

I think it is time to create a MS DOS 6.0  FAQ since lots of questions
about it are actually flooding the net.  I won't be able to write it
my self because of the lack of time/knowledge/experience.

There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can
cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies
widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults
pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia)
is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae
is the most common cause.

What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis,
which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in
both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism
is also called the ""meningococcus"", and is the source of the
common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in
the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases),
the organism typically causes death within a day. 

This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats
of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different
ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case. 

Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts
of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.

Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis
is a huge topic, and sci.med can't do it justice.

Yeah, the ""Feingold Diet"" is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADD
who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents
who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
children's development.  So much for the value of ""interesting anecdotal
results"".  People will believe anything if they want to.

The tribe will be in town from April 16 to the 19th.
There are ALWAYS tickets available! (Though they are playing Toronto,
and many Toronto fans make the trip to Cleveland as it is easier to
get tickets in Cleveland than in Toronto.  Either way, I seriously

   First this man promotes the dissolution of the Jews through an

of 'fundamentalist' Jews who will object.  This clown even called
for 'buying' the dissolution of the Jewish people.

   Does this idiot mean to suggest that any Jew who objects to an
imibicilic notion like this is fundamentalist?  Or does he simply
mean to insult the orthodox by using the word 'fundamentalist?'

   I am not orthodox.  I am not fundamentalist.  I would desire a

Can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but I finally fixed my mouse
jumpiness problems: I installed a bus mouse. (Sorry, I didn't say the solution
was free.) In the past I'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse.
(Cleaning it, unloading all kinds of TSRs, turning off SMARTDRV write
cacheing, changing COM ports, ...) Nothing worked. Yesterday I finally broke
down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse. The improvement is even better
than I had imagined! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy
all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so
used to it I didn't notice. My wife, who uses the computer about once a
month, noticed the improvement literally within a second!

I can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems
one you'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you
don't know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes
a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.

Hope this helps someone else. If you're anywhere near as frustrated as I
was, it's well worth the $80.

I am no expert on this.  But I am pretty sure there is no way to recover this.  IDE drive has mapping information written directly on drives.  When you  low level format it, the information itself is gone as well, I don't think you can get it back unless you send it back to Western Digital and ask them to refurbish it for you.

You make it sound like this behavior is new.  It isn't.  A lot of
pedestrian bridges have fencing that curls up over the sidewalk to

I have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile. 
Such systems do exist, but none are presently installed in production autos
that I am aware of.  These are commonly called viscous drive CVTs or
fluidic amplifiers. 

>Contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered (result is no TQ mult)

What the convertor _does_ allow is for the engine to be closer to its
torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's
driveline.  Chevy proved it many years ago with the '70 Camaro (ETs and
terminal 1/4 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 4 speed and
auto cars).  Note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can
get away with fewer gears than a manual, the slip in the convertor makes up
for the fewer ratios (and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed
5 sspeed autos soon to be out, note that some manufacturers are using 6
speed manulas now). 

>Once past lauch however, the converter begins coupling and the TQ multiplication

""We plan... to have a full size (40 binary digit) word hold

	It should be added that this technique of
automatic substitutions into orders,
i.e. the machine's ability to modify its own orders

is absolutely necessary for a flexible code. Thus, if
part of the memory is used as a ""function table"", then
""looking up"" a value of that function for a value of the 
variable which is obtained in the course of the computation
requires that the machine itself should modify, or
rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which
controls this ""looking up"", and the machine can only make this
modification after it has already calculated the value of the 
variable in question.
	On the other hand, this ability of the machine to modify its
own orders is one of the things which makes coding
the non-trivial operation which we have to view it as.""

I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned
examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a
couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not
missing something obvious here...)

Basic Scenario:

	I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of
	files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users 
	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public
	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the
	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The
	result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it
	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the
	machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed
	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal
	private keys during the authentication sequence.

Questions:

	Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any
	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as
	being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)

	It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am
	assisting in ""entrapment"" (the users would send thier key anyway
	and are not being enticed into doing something they would not
	otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?

	Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?

Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...

So if we subvert one of the two escrow agents, we only have a 40-bit

2^40 doesn't sound that big - is digital telephony subject to a known

I won't even recommend books from my congregation.  What you ask sounds
attractive but it is dangerous.  As a new Christian you don't want to be
contaminated with other people's interpretation.  Steep your self in
scripture, and discuss with other christians.  Read if your must but
remember that what other people write is their interpretation.  God has
promised to give you light, so ask for it.

Don't wait too long before attaching yourself to church.  Just remember to
always compare what they teach you with scripture like the Bereans did.

   Try change the GXxor to GXequiv.  I have to do this for programs that

Sorry about not mentioning platform... my original post was to mac.programmer,

I'd like the 3D software to run on primarily Mac in either C, Object Pascal
(Think or MPW). But, I'll port to Windows later, so a package that runs on
Mac and has a Windows version would be ideal.

I'm looking for a package that has low upfront costs, and reasonable licensing

I don't know how many hours you've spent on this, but the Sun User
Group makes X11R5 available on CD-ROM to its members. The 1992.1 disk
has both sources and binaries and it sells for $50.  I've tagged a
table of contents and an orderform on below if anyone's interested.

SUG CD 1992.1 is X11R5 and GNU on a CDROM, priced at $50 to SUG
members, including a caddy!

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk
contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries,
almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net
postings, priced at only $250.

Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added
as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk
set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second
available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks.

The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains
a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members (and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per
disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a
SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live
within the US or $55 outside.

The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used
by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a
total of 543MB of material, including:

X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after
the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0
distribution are included (109MB of material).  Binaries for: X Xsun

COPIES OF CONTRIBUTED X SOURCES (from export.lcs.mit.edu/contrib),
which were then uncompressed/untarred into source directories (212MB).
These are sources only, and some of them were (after the date of

distributions.

I have an SE/30 with a 80 meg HD which dates back to April 1989.  When I
originally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This
was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.

Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is
powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given
the ""no disk to boot from"" icon.  However, upon turing the
computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  
Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot 
button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power
off and on always works.

This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before
it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how
it can be fixed?

I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to 
""come up to speed"" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that
allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before 
trying to access the HD?

Thanks!

I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me.

I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer, and since I don't have
much experience with programming X, I thought this issue might be helpful
as it has a section on debugging, and a section on the 40 most common errors
in programming X.

At the end of the errors section, there are the following references for
tutorials on X programming style.  They are:

Rosenthal, David -   A simple X11 client program
  Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference, 1988.

Lemke, D., and Rosenthal, D. -  Visualizing X11 clients
  Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference, 1989.


Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably)
electronic form?

Or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to
programming X (I'll be looking at the bookstore for books, so I am really
only asking about what I can find on the net.)

Thanks,

David Simpson

I am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from
a MC146818A Real Time Clock.  Has anyone out there had some experience
in doing this?  The specs call for a few sequences to be met before
standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but
I thought that I had it worked out.  However, with a 32kHz crystal the
lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA.  This is
three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting
to create.

I have done the following things:

1) Made sure that RESET/ is asserted for Trlh after powerup, and AS is
   low during this time.


2) Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD/ or
   WR/ during which STBY/ was asserted.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks very much,

Martin.

Be sure to say ""chronic"" dizziness, not just dizziness.  Most
patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better.
The vertiginous spells of Meniere's will also eventually go

This may have helped you, but I'm not sure it is good general
advice.  The odds that you are going to find some miracle with
your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge
for this or any other disease are slim.  When good answers to these
problems are found, it is usually in all the newspapers.  Until
then, spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical
problem may divert that energy from more productive things
in life.  A limited amount should be spent to assure yourself
that your doctor gave you the correct story, but after it becomes
clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine
has no good solution, perhaps the best strategy is to join
the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to
make a career out of it.

It would be in a different location, so a directional antenna could
probably lock in on just the one monitor. Failing that, a phased array
could likely seperate the signals. Admittedly, this is expensive, but
so is all the rest of this stuff anyway.

Sorry Len, this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs.
Being overweight and having no work ethic, leading to being injury prone with
nothing to loose, might have been corrected in Richmond.  (Did you intend a

This brings back the long suffering memories of pre-chop Braves fans who

Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.
It's small enough that I will attach it.

I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB
cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to
40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective
difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache
card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously
better.  I do not have an FPU.

The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers
offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference
between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well
under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.

If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to
see them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called
""Performance Rating"" numbers by themselves are of no interest. 

Cheers.

I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative. Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and
Islam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say.
It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. 
I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe
on the same God, ""the God of Ebrahim"" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story?
How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them 
would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same
God, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?


Man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.
A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.
The praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes
that God will help him when he prays.
Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the 
religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to
make their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his
cut too! 

Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other
helps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts 
that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will
see the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop
another religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would
to come its senses, before it is too late?


P.S. on the side

Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created
the earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God
you have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created
God through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?

Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught
him about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?
Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad
wanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? 

I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.
Look at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will
have the same ending!!!!!!!!

Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than
plotting each others distruction.  There is one earth, One life and one God. Let's all man kind be good toward
each other.

God help us all.
Peace

I can't speak for the organizations you cited but everywhere you look in
our society and government, one can see the relentless movement toward
one world government.  The fact that the media demeans such charished 
values as patriotism, nationalism and protectionism are some of the
clues.  The fact that we are sapping the economic strength of americans
to prop up a former and possibly future enemy is just another.  The fact
the words like community of nations, global village and international
business are in vogue are others.  International corporations are 
destroying our identy and economy and the propaganda they are playing
through the media and government is over powering our ability to resist.
Our porous border both people and trade are an indiciation that we have
already lost a great deal of sovergnty.

The bottome line is that the single most evil aspect of One World
Government is that you have nowhere to run to and history has proven
that would be a disaster.

  OK, Doug is right, it would be obstruction of justice, blah blah blah,
BUT, saying ""I forgot"" is a lie, which is just as bad from a moral point
of view _IF_ you think ""lawfulness"" is a good in and of itself (which 
admittedly most people do not.)  But there's an even better way out of this.
PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally, you can probably
plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key.  The
government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which ""may
tend to incriminate"" that defendant.  Though this has never been applied
in the cryptography context (at least as far as I can tell) it seems an
obvious application to me.  

 This may be a common suggestion in this group, but if it's not (I'm new
here) I'd love to hear what people have to say about it.  Since I don't
really read this group (and since the subject matter is more legal than
cryptoid) maybe misc.legal.computing would be an appropriate place?

i agree -- if you are going to find out anything from people who don't
share your beliefs, do not attack them or condescend to them and hope
to get a neutral picture of them.  come to them with an open mind.

well, you do believe in something, as i see it, even if it is a sort
of ""anti-belief"" (no negative connotation meant; i mean simply that
you believe that God _does not_ exist).  christians can also feel that
sense of ""difference"", however, when they are associated with ""those
weird televangelists who always talk about satan"".  if you'll excuse
the cliched sound of this, everyone has to deal with his/ her
differences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheist
could be hard for you; being a christian is sometimes hard for me.

you should not have to repress how you feel -- you should be able to
discuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learn
from any belief, which can enrich your own -- by asking myself the
questions that atheists may ask me, i can learn the answers and become
stronger in my faith.  if my faith can't support knowing the answers
to those questions, it is weak and untrue.

in some way the pressures were different, of course, because you

ouch, yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with an
open heart -- including people of ""our own camp"" with whom we
completely disagree.  by the same token, i believe that accusation and
suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith,
nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our
religion.  i have a different idea of mission: be what i am, a
christian who is happy in her faith, and if others see that and want
to know about either the happiness or the religion, i'll share what i
know without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at some
point you just have to agree to disagree -- acceptance of diversity,
not uniformity, is the way to sow peace....

Since the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly
constructed, is irrelevant.  I will however, respond to a few points
you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.


>They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.

	And those fleeing Arab lands, where Jews were second class
citizens. 

>Plus they paid fair market value, etc...

	Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land
they bought.

>They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy.

	You know, Sam, when people start talking about an
International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like
anti-Semitic bull.

	The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple.
Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were
conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National
home for the Jews.

	Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you
claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant)
International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you
could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only
democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group.
The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for
whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are
there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic
states?

	I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab
population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When
I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an
Israeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other
neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?

	How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a

arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.

Hello again netters,
	I finally received the information about Imagine for the PC.  They are presently shipping Version 2.0 of the software and will release Version 3.0 in the first quarter of 1993 (or so they say).  The upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 is $100.00.  To purchase Imagine 2.0, it costs $495.00 or if you are upgrading from another eligible (call them for info) modeler, it is only $200.00 plus shipping & handling.   It requires a PC with 4 Megs a Math Coprocessor, and Dos 5.0 or up and a Microsoft Mouse and SVGA card.
	Thanks for all your replies about the product.  I have received many contrasting replies, but once I scrounge the money together, I think I will take the plunge.  Thanks again.
	Here is the info for Impulse if you want to find out more or get the sheet they sent.

How do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were
a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked
unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would
have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can
maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.

In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-
way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.
He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and
Quinn in my estimation.

I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen
in hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.

I don't know the exact coverage in the states.  In Canada it is covered
by TSN, so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage!  I don't know!

As for the picks
Ottawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will 
go #1. He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.  IMO I would
take Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships.  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.

San Jose will then get Kariya.

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov (I think that's it) or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)

Because of expansion I won't go further but I will name other of the
blue chip prospects

   - Chris Gratton
   - Chris Pridham
   - a swedish player who I can't remember his name

Draft Order
-----------
1) Ottawa
2) San Jose
3) Tampa Bay
4) South Florida or Anahiem
5) South Florida or Anahiem
6) Hartford
7) Edmonton
8) Dallas
9) NY Rangers
10) Philadelphia

the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - I don't have the standings here
and am guessing 

(In my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with Kariya 
 leading the way but not going #1)

	I'd like to see this info as well.  As for wavelength, I think
you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM
+/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common
I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940.
I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of
difference.

	Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote,
and go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very
detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the
transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding
specs. if the system uses that.

I agree, I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism.. You

psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent
criminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think
it's the increase in designer drugs... others think it's a communist plot.
Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society
are far too complicated for us to control. We just have to hold on to the

things for sure, depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT
has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American
doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple
(early March).

Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French
and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is
it because too many people take French and German in college to make
the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.
Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.

For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't
make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical
monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they
must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the
U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis
E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.

Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's
health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one
small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.

Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany
case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public
sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra
insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward
accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal
benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care.

At that point, they wouldn't even consider a ""voucher"" approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.

It is ""free"" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two
things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when
working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying
for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my
pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only
annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda.

The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer 
1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 
1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%
afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private
hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same
cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.
Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,
the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not
gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and
private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.

Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its
just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada
and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.

When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe
amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec
last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's
public health insurance plan.

Dorin,
Let's not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. The
distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people
whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these
soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And
resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich
were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters).
Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by
resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the
Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the
hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the
Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the
only option they see as viable. (Don't forget that it worked in driving
out the US)

You asked a question, and now you don't want people to answer?  I believe
a legitimate question was asked.  Why shouldn't cost and safety be used
(at least in part) to determine legality?

I'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea.
Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that 
drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as
William F. Buckley supports it.

Your examples (except for prostitution) fail miserably to meet both criteria
(safer AND cheaper).  Obviously, killing people is not ""safe"".  As for
prostitution, why shouldn't it be legal?

Not to drag this out anymore, but....

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that
in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs
presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.

A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs
can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been
an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements
for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.
Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to ""prove"" that
the disease exists.

This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:

1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs
had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5
months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further
clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So
these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous
recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations
longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't
have the same chronicity that some see in humans.

2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the
vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want
the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine
efficacy.

Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations
of this vaccine in the next year or so.

Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the
concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I 
suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic 
benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a
human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic
benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed
and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the 
equivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billion
for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done
than because they expect to make money off the deal.

Note: I am *not* a cable freak, so I might have completely
misunderstood what you said.  Also, my math is frequently noted for
being wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.

I assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start and
one stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes
per second is 1.44K.

Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in
stereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to a
Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially if
you think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/A
converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been
cut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher
frequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome
that problem.)

On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,
you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and
then linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,
but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in
that respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, and
compression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of
less than 5% were common.  Although I must say that these were musical
sounds, not speech.

Have fun.

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
you may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a ""turn off"" command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can

That is absolutely correct.  They have a streak of meanness that runs much
deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height
of the 60's racial struggles.  I am absolutely convinced that there are
kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the
human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that
have ever walked the earth.  They will prevail unless the rest of humanity
decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral
humans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their
own protection.  In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities
and police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of
the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.

Gee, I guess you touched my hot button.  I'd better go cool off somewhere.

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of
the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting
any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though ""accepted"", may
not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick
buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is
significantly inflated by these ""quacks of a different color"".  In fact, I'd
say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the
true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus
on these ""quacks"" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and-
destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-
traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.


***************************************************
Now to make a general comment on many recent posts:
***************************************************

Lately I've seen the word ""quack"" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or
doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical
subject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say ""quack-quack"" and
somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over
on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach
you in medical school - how to throw your authority around?

Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  ""quack"" is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.
The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming
from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real
scary.

But what do I know, I've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this
newsgroup as being 'anal retentive', and 'psychotic'.  I look forward to more
net.diagnoses.  Hey, they're free.


Jon ""Quacks 'R Us"" Noring


(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories, such as the ""yeast theory"", should create your own moderated group.
You can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.AMA-approved, so you
can keep anal-retentives like me out of it.)

i have no idea, nor do i care.  however, i'd like to point out that
blomberg got the first plate appearance by a designated hitter, and
the first walk by a designated hitter.  i am not sure, but i do not

NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE

	* INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage
	  by a man who infiltrated political groups

By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.

SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time
art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In
reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and
amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40
years.

His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was
so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen
to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi
(D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.

For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White
Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he
obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. 
And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government
to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.

These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former
Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with
police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide
intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.

Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper
activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They
have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.

Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents
released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details
of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line
into illegal territory.

At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air
with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with
foreign agents and code names like ""Ironsides"" and ""Flipper.""

On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a
pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa,
Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties
to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him. 
Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed
him.

The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA
agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing
confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.

Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by
the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its
contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification
cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for
four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank
birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from
various agencies.

Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a
black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of
blindfolded and chained men.

Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the
ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information
on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one
target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.

Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would
constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in
an affidavit for a search warrant.

The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil
rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on
groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's
fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a
reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with
police agencies and journalists. 

However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files
on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the
American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United
Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for
Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the
Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.

The computer files also included information on several members of
Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman
Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey
from the Bay Area.

In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation
League has collected information on political activists in the Los
Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely
with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in
intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism
expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence
officer.

A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew
nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los
Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the
investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined
comment.

Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy
drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a
volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a
book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.

Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by
the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the
mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations
up and down the West Coast.

To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled
through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never
missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.

""I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all
anti-democratic movements,"" Bullock said.  "". . . Officially, I'm only
a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not
be officially connected with me.""

Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists
to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own
name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.

""I'm one of a kind,"" he told police.

In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become
known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a
shotgun who threatened to kill him.

In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a
synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and
matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by
police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close
friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco
police intelligence division.

Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An
FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:

""Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and
would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to
Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to
Bullock.""

From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876
individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files
contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.

In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of
information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of
meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels
and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100
bills.

Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled
only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published
by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli --
and submitted it as his own work.

Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence. 
Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government
evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, ""I may be gay but I'm a
straight arrow.""

In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about
engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to
violate the law.

For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records
and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of
the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said
Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence
files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under
department policy.

Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation
of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San
Francisco office.

Bullock seemed proud of his ""Operation Eavesdrop,"" in which he used a
paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan
Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by
members of the right-wing group.  ""For a short time, it was
wonderful,"" he told police.

In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago
as a ""fact-finder"" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go
undercover to the meetings of target groups.

Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles
ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had ""anti-Israel
leanings"" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such
sentiment.

Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he
attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a
rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for
Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival
and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate
group.

Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the
probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation. 
Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the
investigation.

Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed
by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.

 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.'
 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-'
 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.'
 ""We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....
 'I don't believe you,"" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The 
  man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. 
  I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and 
  went inside.

 The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for 
 its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an 
 iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black 
 with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As 
 the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face 
 up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what 
 was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, 
 as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so 
 I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  
 slashed genitals.""

p. 363 (first paragraph). 

 'How many people lived there?'
 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.
 'Did you see any Turk officers?'
 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'

 ""The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - 
 Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled
 so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into 
 laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense
 of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,
 Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
 have been.

 From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
 The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over
 the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last 
 scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, 
 looms, even spinning-wheels.

 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must 
 leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And 
 for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. 
 Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in 
 a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'""

p. 354.

""At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
 high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,
 but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
 of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on
 Moslem villages.""

p. 358.

""It will be three hours to take,"" Dro told me. We'd close in on three
 sides.
""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanov
said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.
""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror.""
""Soldiers or civilians?"" I asked.
""There is no difference,"" said Dro. ""All are armed, in uniform or not.""
""But the women and children?""
""Will fly with the others as best they may.""

p. 360.

""The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet 
 down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said 
 Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'

 Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets
 clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;
 then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the
 spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though 
 I heard our Utica brass roar.

 As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing
 of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,
 dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
 puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.
 The came a shrill wailing.

 Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about
 house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in
 clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen
 were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.

 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape
 over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked
 breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by
 afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and
 the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.

 At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward
 Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and 
 tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,
 through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-
 arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.""

p. 361 (fourth paragraph).

""Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, 
 large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble 
 where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet 
 had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between 
 the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun 
 dress.

 The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He 
 lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the 
 pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed 
 just below his neck, into the spine. 

 There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was 
 empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking 
 colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.""

p. 358.

 ""...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled
  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, 
  Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -

  break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'

And the reason that the Soviet Union couldn't achieve the ideal of pure

Clement, although he has a pleasant personality (aggravatingly pleasant

I am going to be getting a C650 soon, but I don;t want Apple 
to come out with the Cyclones and the Tempest in a month
and have the price drop on the system I want.  I have negotiated a 
good deal with a supplier for a C650 8/80 and I would like to jump on it,
but, again, I don't want the price drop to smuther me.  BTW, the deal
I have is a C650 8/80 with mouse for $2295... does anyone know of a better
deal?

Don't get too excited; Signetics, not Motorola, gave the 68070 its number.
The 68070, if I understand rightly, uses the 68000 instruction set, and has
an on-chip serial port and DMA.  (It will run at up to 15 MHz--I'm typing
at a computer using a 68070 running at that rate, so I know that it can
do so--so I seriously doubt the clock rate that ricardo@rchland.vnet.ibm.com
claims.)

I did this.  I use a relay (Radio Shack 4PDT) instead of a huge
switch.  This way, if the relay breaks, my drives will still work.

It works fine, but you may still need to change the CMOS before the
drive switch will work correctly for some programs.

chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was
a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and
age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the
hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our
minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost
from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in
the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over
its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.

Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support

to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there
will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,
but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you

Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,
but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result
in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into
systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*
you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)

won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we

In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a
project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in
hassles.

The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to
the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically
down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any
new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --
the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,
you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns
and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.

The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for
more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.
For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop
a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper
might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less
ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing
sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting
money in a big way.

Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a
minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which
dominates the cost of the project.

It sound like to me that your carbs are not jetted properly.

Organization: New York State Institute for Sebastian Cabot Studies

Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6

[New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]


Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite
automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article
will provide the essential information for doing so on standard
Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups
are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com
for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive
mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can
list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the
Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)

First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,
or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also
important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems
like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you
have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is
probably not good enough.

Listserv:

There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which
is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of
the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this
article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should
probably  look at listserv carefully.

The Alias file:

On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on
whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:

foo:   bar, baz, bletch


which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is
redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest
possible email list is 

my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address
my-favorite-car-request: my-address

this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that
you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can
do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:

my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list
my-favorite-car-request: my-address

Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated
addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,
owned by the list admin.

Bounced Mail:

this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the
members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.
Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up
is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,
by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)


school-request:   welty
school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list
school: ""|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school""
owner-school: school-request
owner-school-out: school-request


here's what is going on here:

the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail
coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point
of contact for administrative duties.

school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,
it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending
the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;
the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the
actual list members.

the shell script i use is as follows:

-----------------
#!/bin/sh
cd /tmp
sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \
        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \
         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \
         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \
         cat -) | \
        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \
                -F ""The ${1} Mailing List"" ${1}-rebroadcast
exit 0
-------------------

note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name
is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple
lists (i run several out of this site.)
the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming
message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:
99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request
or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.

For digested lists, there is some digestification software around.
Hopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version
of this posting.

A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a
philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything
evil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity -
man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing
that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all
who consider themselves ""christians"" are (even those who manage to head
their own ""churches"").  ""Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will
enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who
is in heaven."" - Matt. 7:21.

Again, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal
crossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What
historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis-

Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you
into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving
you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:
1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain
it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this
salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain
modern offshoots like the ""new age movement"" teach or does he require God's
help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such
help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for
some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a
position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,
of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).
The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read ""A Pilgrim's
Progress,"" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).

>In God(ess)'s name

Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a
conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You
wrote that ""I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most
of the teachings of christ"".  Well, Christ referred to God as ""My Father"",
not ""My Mother"", and while the ""maleness"" of God is not the same as the
maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not
honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,
or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent
to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - 
english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God
chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human
population.

Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of
the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the
last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this
article.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope I
may have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of
mind, something to contemplate.

Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a ""boxer"" type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of
small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4
uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application.

For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.
It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is
exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack.

All very true.  I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends.
Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to
learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was
looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the
safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot
more ""safe""  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course
this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You
would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I
like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool
(guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as
my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with
a ""traditional"" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.

Comet Gehrels 3, which was discovered in 1977, was determined to have

may remain in orbit around Jupiter long enough to allow Galileo to

Or, _documentation_ for the program ;-).  A lot of shareware out there is 
very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get 
documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version.  Perhaps even

Well, your Armenian grandparents were fascist. As early as 1934, K. S. 
Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians

        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]

At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would
actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World
War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish
population of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological
tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before
the outbreak of the Second World War.

In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted
in the 'Hairenik Weekly:' 

""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall 
 see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations
 and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to
 the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are
 strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.
 On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is
 bereft of social sanctities.""[2]

   1934), Preface.

that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has.
Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually
be seen by almost everyone on Earth.  Only our collective disapproval

        I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and
could use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is
familiar with them.
 
        The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB
tower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB, 8MB, 200MB IDE, a Mitsumi
CD-ROM (with software bundle), Media Vision Sound board, 14"" CTX 1468NI,
128K Cache, and the usual drives, ports, & OS software.  Since my budget is
$2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it
IS too good to be true, of course). Among other things, I've never seen a
review of the Budget systems (or their parent company, Micro Smart), or of
the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be
appreciated.
 
        In a similar vein, the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's
Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14"" MI
monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the
firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig

There has been some talk recently of Latin rites from the early Church used to
bless same-sex unions.If anyone has any idea where copies of these rites
exist (in whole or in part), please notify me by e-mail.  (I understand that
similar ceremonies written in Slavonic exist as well.  Let me know where I can
find these.)  It doesn't matter whether the Latin rite is in the original or a

The above is probably not the most representative paragraph, but I
thought I'd hop on, anyway...

What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's
fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation
than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is
that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he
had the free will to ""choose"" evil.  But where did that choice come
from?

We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a
tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover,
invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God
had not given origin to?

Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will?
We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me
as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like
salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.

At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly
coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...

Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had
perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an
act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to
exist for the first time?

I have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler  
built into the motherboard. I want to add a SCSI drive (a quantum prodrive  
425F 425 MG formatted). I have no documentation at all and I need your  
help!

As I understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive.  Could you  
please tell me if I'm right..

1- Buy a SCSI contoler.  Which one? I know Adaptec is good, but they are  
kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want  
it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on  
the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the  
adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the  
quantum?

2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable.
Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and  
all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.

3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type  
of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive.

4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I  
think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with  
SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual  
(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want  
the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?

Well that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I'm forgetting? 
Any help is *really* appreciated, I'm lost...

Way back in the early years (~50's) it took 8 wins to garner the Stanley Cup. 
Soooooo, a couple of local fish mongers (local to the Joe Louis Arena, that is)
started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win.  After
each victory, one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the
ice.  (They are dead by the way.)  It was a brilliant marketing strategy to

I know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the

Koufax was one of two Jewish HOFs: the other is Hank Greenberg.

Ken Holtzman, Saul Rogovin, Ed Reulbach.

This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he
smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique
I'd never seen before.

He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.
The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,
made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.

In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar
quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two
teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.

On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with
two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly
went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.

Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises
and concerns me are:

1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?

2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color
    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring
    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected
    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,
    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being
    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?

3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated
    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract
    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever
    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea
    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do
    so.

WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),
I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy
taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently
stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,
getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,
then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.

My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight
stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort
of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after
the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,
just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?

I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping
on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because
it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill
non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this
duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals
at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the
floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire
in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.

And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that
smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains
nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually
has some standing, don't know about the others.

An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was
discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting
a lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.
This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.
The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended
himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day
for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-
broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my
immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal
broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!

One reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it

This is *exactly* what the public in France & Italy perceive to be the

Wrong.  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord.
The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style
first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would
encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy.
Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will
be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties
will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.

(The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with
Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a
portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)

Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians
are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and
Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party
system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

It's about time.

Well, as funny as your little comment may seem, it has very little to
do with your personal privacy as a citizen, and about the governemnt
being able to look at everything you have ever typed into a computer
at one point or another.

This ""Clipper Chip"" stuff is the seeds for nightmares to make the 
Nightmare on Elmstreet cheese-on-celluloid movies look like episodes
of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.

IF the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by
everyone, and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments
and stored at two separate, albeit easy to find places, and that key is
only 80 bits to begin with, we are screwed (pardon the allusion to the 
affore-mentioned article)!

the gov, I believe, as do many others probably already have the cracking chips
for this Clipper Chip made.  Hell, they probably based the encoder on the 
chip that cracks it, that way it's easier to break the code, but since it is a 
classified algorythm, no one knows that they can crack it so easily.

I, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support 
organizations (and even disorganizations) who are fighting against this
Clipper Chip in any way that I can.

I do not want the government to be able to have access, even with a search
warrant, to my keys... and I don't want those keys to be only 80 bits long
to begin with!

I sure did use version 3.2. It works fine with most software but NOT

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.

>I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P

Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy
than anyone else...and was the first GM to ""waste"" high draft choices
on young Russians...Devallano would still be GM but he succombed to
Demers pleading to make the Oates-Federko et al trade...which is the
deal that sealed his fate.

Murray has made some decent trades...no doubt...but these are more
due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on
his part...Washington was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they
essentially gave him away...and Carson was really a big anchor to
the team, and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul
Coffey for deadweight.

If Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short...
then he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available,
and he was unable to pull the trigger.  It is his judgement that he
has enough with what he's got...Yzerman doesn't have that many more
years in his prime.

die. On an annual basis, I spend much less on bike stuff than Amy the Wonder

Fine.  Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable
with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can
be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is
eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious 
consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  

For example, does ""non-initiated force"" (coercion) include tax collection?
Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned
by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the
state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the
fact arbitration/legal compulsion?

Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants
is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a 
complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out, 
however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group 
of ""seminar participants"" to ""embrace"" their philosophy, their 
propaganda skills need to be honed.  

Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a 
society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper
government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities
can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said,
the state will just wither away.  

On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating 
virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the 
current society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like
socialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until 
everyone has had the benefit of ""re-education"" through regular 
""seminar"" training?

I was wondering if any of you out there want to trade or sell games.  I

      Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to
get a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question
quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.

>I HAVE to be licensed to drive.  

      In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed
to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.

>My car
>MUST be registered.  

       Most states do not require the registration of cars that are
not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do
so for tax purposes more than anything else.
    
>I MUST (at least where I live) have liability
>insurance on both myself driving and my car (if someone else had an

       Many states do not currently require this, and most, again,
only make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused 
is not required to have insurance.

>Hmm, wouldn't manditory saftey classes, registration
>of both the owner and gun, and manditory liability insurance be nice for
>gun owners.

       The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are
significant difference between making rules for *use on public property*
and *making rules for ownership*.

       The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this
have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and
have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are
never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for
a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York,
Chicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun
owners would, in theory, support these planes.  (Although the
numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem, that
intentional misuse is).  They've simply seen it abused and are leery of
the next person who comes down the pike with a ""reasonable"" suggestion
they've already seen abused.

I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply, and now we
have another bug report on the same subject. Can anybody help me out?

How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one
menu entry.

In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says ""For information
on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4..."", this is so you
know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to
Vol. 4 it says, ""Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is
nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For
example, the translation:

	Shift<Key>q:	quit()

will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the Shift key (and the q key).

This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl<Key>o should do
what I want, but it doesn't, it doesn't work if the user presses the
control key, the shift key, and the o key.

Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? Keep in
mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use
XtInstallAccelerators().

I am using Motif 1.1.3 on a DECstation 5000 but I have also tried it
on an HP using Motif 1.1.3 and 1.2.

That's right, and this is pretty impossible, right?  It would be ideal if
we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then
determine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not
possible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with
it some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological
burdens, too.

Well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism,
they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually ""believing""
in racism.  Of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you
originated it.

The newer the drive, the less problem you will have. The old ten and fifteen

Are you suggesting that God supports genocide?
Perhaps the Germans were ""punishing"" Jews on God's behalf?

Any God who works that way is indescribably evil, and unworthy of

Well, in the latest Windows magazine, there is an advertisement for a program
that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk (Uninstaller)
but it can be used to update a network, but only for deleting, not adding
or changing their *.ini files.  (Uninstaller, by MicroHelp Inc.  $79
1-800-922-3383)

I am also looking for an *.ini updater for my PC network, and so far without
any luck.  So for the time being I have been pushing DOS and it's batch
language to its limit...look into DOS 5.0's (I am assumming that DOS 6.0
has the same command, maybe even more..or less..improved) REPLACE command.
I use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch
file that is run everytime they invoke Windows.  This basically overwrites
their color schemes, but does what I need it to do.  Not neat, but does
the job...I'm looking for a better solution though.

No not at all. I'm using SS24X with BIOS 2.03 and driver

Is there already a newer driver published?

I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,
to put both machines on one line.  You order distinctive
ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here.
You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When
someone calls this number, your phone rings with short
rings instead of long rings.

You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax
on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #.
A device would measure the length of rings.  When it
detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.
Five rings later your fax picks up the call.

This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80
switches now available.

But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new
# to my friends and customers.  This should leave the
old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the
phone when I hear the long rings.

Not to worry.  The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost 
every major Xian church there is.  For centuries now.  And still they 
stand.  They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure.
They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the 
Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of 
Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is 
known.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the 
Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the 
Boobtist Witch-hunt.
  Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with 
their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on 
their Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and 
more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a 
handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop 
'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.
  So as far as I am concerned, the louder, ruder, and more outrageous 
an Anti-Masonic Crusade these old goats mount, the better.

Pop some pocorn and get a center row seat.  The circus is about to begin.
And, Oh Look!  HERE COME THE CLOWNS!

Hiya 

I'm a VERY amuture astronomer in Adelaide Australia, and today, I heard some
very interesting and exciting news from a local program on TV. As I couldn't
find anything on it on the news server, I have posted this. However, if it is
old information, tell me, and ill sue the TV station for saying they are 
'Up to date' ;-)

(Also, my news server could be slow. . so . . .!!!

I only caught the end of the article, so all the information on the topic
is not known to me at the moment.

The news is of a small 'psudo' planet outside the orbit of pluto found in a 
Hawiian obsevatory, supposably 'recently' - acording to the report.
It was meant to be about 150miles in diamater, and a faily large distance 
from the plutos orbit.  (it had a computer drawing, and the orbit distance
from pluto was about the same as neptune to pluto when they are furthest
apart.  This is all I found out about it. OH it is called Karna. (un-officially
).  
CAn anyone give any more information to me on it???

Thanx.

If you specify the rootwindow when you are creating your GC. You may 
use Xlib to draw over multiple windows. 
I have an application that does something similar for rubber banding.

 curs_move = XCreateFontCursor (disp_data, XC_crosshair);

 geom_vals.foreground     = blck_pixl ^ grey_dark;
 geom_vals.plane_mask     = AllPlanes;
 geom_vals.line_width     = 0;
 geom_vals.function       = GXxor;
 geom_vals.subwindow_mode = IncludeInferiors;
 evnt_mask= GCForeground | GCPlaneMask | GCLineWidth | GCFunction
                                                     | GCSubwindowMode;
 geom_gcon= XCreateGC (disp_data, root_iden, evnt_mask, &geom_vals);



later I can move the rubber band or bands using the following logic

/**********************************************************************/

	Nor, to point out the obvious, are the deluded, siege-mentality

Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire
lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The
main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by
the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been
excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city
of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of
Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter
of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto
the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle
should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of
Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks
had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the
Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd
Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they
considered heretics, even though those ""heretics"" were fighting for the
cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish
hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some
hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of
Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)

   Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, take
it a step further.  Write yourself a minimal ""file system"" program that
is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a
directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.

   The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part
of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all
allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the
partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd
partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach
might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS
system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage 
unit of a ""cluster"" there is unused physical space on the disk between
the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These
dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file
system.

   Now you have a situation where no encrypted data ""appears"" on your
disk at all :-).

The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the
book is *useless*. Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed
is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)

The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately,
System 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.

Well, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1,
but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes
channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a
channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many
sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.
Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to
inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the
only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an
*undocumented* flag and modify it.

Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get
rid of the bugs.

Any better suggestions? (Silent games is not among the acceptab|e solutions.)

Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in
emphasis.  Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days
a week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have
similar, religious organizations.  A persons religious belief seems more
as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions.
Of course, people would have to come up with more fascinating 
rationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch...

It seems to me, that for most people, religion in America doesn't matter
that much.  You have extreemists on both ends, but a large majority don't
make too much of an issue about it as long as you don't.  Now, admittedly,
I have never had to suffer the ""Bible Belt"", but I am just north of it
and see the fringes, and the reasonable people in most things tend to be
reasonable in religion as well.

I don't bother according a higher value to my thinking, or just about
anybodys thinking.  I don't want to fall in that trap.  Because if you 
do start that, then you are then to decide which is better, says whom,
why, is there a best, and also what to do about those who have inferior
modes of thinking.  IDIC  (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations.)

This was an open question.  I assumed that if Mr. Archer is a chronic
liar, someone whould have documented it.   This assumption is based on
how talk.origins regulars have documented numerous cases of Creationist
deceptions (such as Duane Guish and his friends).

No long list of Archer mistakes has yet been given, so this may be just
an isolated incident...

It sounds like something/one may have set the 1000's separator to ""."" in
Contol Panel (under International).  This makes 23,482 look like 23.482
and File Manager is chopping off what it thinks is the decimal part of
the file size. 3,356,345 becomes 3.356.345, and again, File Manager is
confused by the decimal points where there should be commas, chopping
off everything to the right of the first period.

I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that 
every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it
replaced.  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products
then available.   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon.  Multi-processors
were slower then  existent single processors.

What the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised either
theoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities.

I think that the DC-1  may g=fit into this same model.

ELV's can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT,  but 
an SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs.

This is kind of a speculative posting,  but I thought i'd throw it out as
a hjistorical framework  for those interested in the project.

There is, unfortunately, precedent for the U.S. government saving children by

Subject: Hebrew grammar texts--choose English or German?
Organization: Kalamazoo College Alumni Association
Lines: 28

Greetings,

Probably a tired old horse, but...  maybe with a slightly different
twist.  I wanted to know if there are any good English-language texts
for learning ancient Hebrew, and how these compare with German
educational texts qualitywise, if anybody has an idea.  I can't figure
out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to
the U.S.

Something I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the
fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the
way early [I'm not a theology student, but I spend a lot of time with
such folks] in their careers.  They take the first two years or so to just
do Greek and Latin and Hebrew [possibly Aramaic, too--who knows].
What's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States?  Is
there a lot of language instruction done?  I really don't have a basis
for comparison.

Regards, Phil

[For better of worse, we don't have the tradition of classical
education in the U.S., so generally if a seminary believes students
should know Greek, they have to teach it.  It's common for seminaries
to require at least a semester each of Hebrew and Greek, though of
course more is required for serious scholarship.  --clh]

51 Arrested for Defying Judge's Order at Abortion Protest Rally
The Miami Herald, April 11, 1993

   Melbourne, Florida --   [...]

   Circuit Judge Robert McGregor's order prohibits anti-abortion pickets
   within 36 feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice.
   Even across the street, they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
   or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic.

   The protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the First Amendment
   to the Constitution.

   ``This is our sidewalk,'' said Joe Carroll, 33, a landscaper who
   marched with his children, Mary Grace, 8, and John, 7.

   ``I am not a rescuer.  I am not a trespasser.  It's just that this is
   my sidewalk.  I am not really protesting abortion.  We are protesting
   denial of our rights of assembly, religion, speech.  This judge is
   trashing the Constitution.''

   The children's grandmother led them away, sobbing, as Carroll and
   his father were arrested.

   Outside the clinic, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Washington,
   D.C.-based Feminist Majority Foundation, called for the Florida
   Legislature and Congress to pass laws as tough as the judge's
   order, which covers only Brevard and Seminole counties.

   ``This cannot go on,'' she said.  ``This is not freedom of speech,
   this is total psychological warfare with violence.  It is ridiculous
   to have to ask clinics to go court-by-court . . . to get protection.''

Walt Weiss tripled just barely inside the right field line and into the
corner, driving in Santiago and Conine.  These were the first two
RBIs.  The third came later when Weiss was knocked in.

	We only need to ask the question: what did the founding fathers 
consider cruel and unusual punishment?

	Hanging? Hanging there slowing being strangled would be very 
painful, both physically and psychologicall, I imagine.

	Firing squad ? [ note: not a clean way to die back in those 
days ], etc. 

	All would be considered cruel under your definition.
	All were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers.

On a Los Angeles radio station last weekend, the lawyers for the
family of the MURDERED rancher said that the Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department had an assessment done of the rancher's property before
the raid.

This strongly implies that the sheriff's department wanted the property;
any drugs (which were not found) were only an excuse.

In Viet Nam, Lt Calley was tried and convicted of murder because his
troops, in a war setting, deliberately killed innocent people. It is time
that the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country adhere to
standards at least as moral as the military's.

Greed killed the rancher, possibly greed killed the Davidian children.
Government greed.

It is time to prosecute the leaders who perform these invasions.

Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank Car
Bomb Explosion
 
Israel Defense Forces Radio, GALEI ZAHAL, reports today that a car
bomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians and
wounded eight IDF soldiers. The blast is believed to be the work of
a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas
exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the
other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an
Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement.
An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may
have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at
the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the
blast suffered light to moderate injuries.



The Arab that was killed was a probably from the Mossad so it is not count 
as a murder.

Yes, Yl|nen is a draft choice of the Jets.  (Assuming, of course, this
is the same Yl|nen that played for Kiekko-Espoo in 1990-91.)  He was a
5th round, 91st overall pick of the Jets in the 1991 entry draft.

I noticed in the summaries that Yl|nen had really begun to play well in
the playoffs.

Not really, though I wouldn't personally say ""the most deserving
candidate wins"".  Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid
season, and there have been several duds in recent years.  But this is
more a factor of mediot biases than anything else.  (I wonder.  If
Amaral hits like he is capable of, will he receive ROTY votes?  He's
only 31, he could have a long career ahead of him!  :-)

I think they are a second-division team.  They should finish ahead of
the Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics.  But I don't think
they'll be above .500.  (I think the East is stronger this year.)

Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible.  This
year their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad.
Even if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in
Abbott.  Sanderson?  Farrell?  I don't believe it.

And while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their
offense lacks punch.  They don't have any bona fide power hitters.
(Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis?  None with more than 20 HR
potential.)

Cheers,

P.S. Which AL team had the most steals last week?  Those go-go Tigers!
The mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed ""more

Hello to everybody,
I write here because I am kind of desperate. For about six weeks, I've been
suffering on pains in my left head side, the left leg and sometimes the left 
arm. I made many tests (e.g. computer tomography, negative, lyme borreliosis,
negative, all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range), they're
all o.K., so I should be healthy. As a matter of fact, I am not feeling so.
I was also at a Neurologist's too, he considered me healthy too.

The blood tests have shown that I have little too much of Hemoglobin (17.5,
common range is 14 to 17, I unfortunately do not know about the units).
Could these hemi-sided pains be the result of this or of a also possible
block of the neck muscles ?

I have no fever, and I am not feeling entirely sick, but neither entirely

I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed
to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now
get a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago, when I bought this
pkg., it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is
generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for
$99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video
card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech
Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the 
fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is
delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a
few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos.

It would if malpractice and ""defensive medicine"" were the main
factors in explaining spiralling US health care costs, but they aren't.

Although Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems are
greater in the US than Canada, they by no means account for the overall
difference in health care costs.  (They do account for a somewhat larger
portion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)

Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of
total health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of 
physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged
paying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  
Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;
they've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health
care costs have increased more than any period in history.

As far as ""defensive medicine"" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its
total impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total
current INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group
that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine
on health care.

As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,
Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification
of MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their
specialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits
while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.

Jim,

Please feel free to correct me and give me some texts.  As far as I can see the
only text which vaugely relates to jewish evangelism is found in Mt. 23:15.
However since this is found only in Mt. it cannot be dated before 90CE which
makes it unusefull for understanding Second Temple Judaism.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  24)! How do I make a screendump or print my application?

	The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window 
or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. 
The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr 
client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:
		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &
and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current
display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an
undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the 
command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for 
specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]

	Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of 
arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.
There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]
is the most recent.
	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders 
XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;
see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.
	A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr
is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: 
soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.
	xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available
from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.

	To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,
which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps
and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for 
use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and
contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive
servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.

	The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and
save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.

	Also: 

	Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 
2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net
in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.

	ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-
capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and 
non-PostScript printers.

	Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) 
include session managers or other desktop programs which include ""print portion
of screen"" or ""take a snapshot"" options. Some platforms also have tools which 
can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, 
have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals 
have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.

	Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct 
support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package 
to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?

	If you need color PostScript in particular, you can 
	- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color 
PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv 
	- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.
You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick 
distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?

	This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider 
instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?

	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ 
Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting 
among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, 
gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;
the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.
	Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in 
particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.
It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).

	Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a
version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are 
later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  
Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; 
see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.

	xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), 
can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, 
GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, 
contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned 
formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on 
it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; 
see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

	The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.
Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available
via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, 
and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.

	The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads
and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image
manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as
contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.

	The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar 
to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, 
weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.

	Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential 
interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is 
a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and 
Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, 
xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a
library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.

	ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from 
export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display
images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF
from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.

	xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written
to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining
simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems
with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed
as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on
export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]
xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.

	A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool
is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package 
also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window?

	The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will
cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the
string which appears in the window titlebar.
	A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:
		echo ""ESC]2;TEXT^G""
where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed,
and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).

	Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to
the current working directory when you change directories:
		alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G'

	The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should 
change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name 
used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the 
icon name.

	Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of
the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the
escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.

	Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with
a ^V.

Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?

The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file 
ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.

O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control 
sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of 
the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version
of the control sequences. [1/93]

Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document
and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a 
compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 
sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was 
published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).

In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.

Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?

	In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to 
""stty pass8"" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as 
	XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
	XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]

In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:
	setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1

        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with 
the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using
`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') 
is Alt-'.

Subject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?

	You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give 
a resource specification like this:
		xterm*geometry: 80x24
then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to
80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. 
But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only
the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:
		xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?

	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. 
However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for 
manipulating the selection will help; e.g. 
	% xselection PRIMARY | lpr
finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a 
window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of
the selection and other properties. A version is on export.
	Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be
adapted to do this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?

	You can use several environment variables to control how resources are 
loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and 
XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for 
application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most
one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from
the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.

	Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a 
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.
Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also 
have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could 
set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up 
app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located):
	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N

The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see 
XtResolvePathname()):

        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the
                application's class name.
        %T      The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the
                literal string ""app-defaults""
        %C      customization resource (R5 only)
        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.
        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"")
        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"")
        %t      The territory part of the display's language string
        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string

	Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is 
""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the 
example omits locale-specific lookup.)
	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm
	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm

	As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above 
app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it 
and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to 
search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.

	Let's consider another example. This time, let's set 
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working 
directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.
	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N

	The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands 
to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging 
because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file 
Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application
from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded
properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,
for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and
%S are useless.

	With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization 
resource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application like this:
	myterm -xrm ""*customization: -color""

	If one of your pathname specifications had the value
""/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be
""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution character 
takes on the value of the customization resource.

	The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N

	(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in
this batch of default settings.)

	The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is 
		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)
		<root>/%L/%N:\
		<root>/%l/%N:\
		<root>/%N:

	<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory 
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other 
than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.

	Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find 
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR 
to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 
compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ""./"", a dot followed 
by a slash.

Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?

The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a
program to change the background before loading the resources; for example, 
your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line 
	DisplayManager.0.authorize: false 
to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also 
	DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb
where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:
	#!/bin/sh
	#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources
	/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap
	/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*
Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a 
general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.

Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?

	When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login
files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;
or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and
source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,
if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your 
.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting
your .xsession file off with ""#!/bin/csh"". 
	If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:
		#!/bin/sh
		# Reset path:
		PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?

	There are several ways to avoid having to do a ""setenv DISPLAY ...""
whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.
	One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It 
includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and
xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.
A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.
	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse
(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from
132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and
$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then 
propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain
		eval `xrlogind`
where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special 
format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to 
recreate the environment variables. [11/90]

	In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on 
another host, and you find
		rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY 
too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh 
can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be 
		xrsh <HOST> xterm

  #! /bin/sh
  # start an X11 process on another host
  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT
  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>
  # rsh $host -n ""setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null""
  #
  # An improved version:
  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)
  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)
  #
  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.  This
  # script combines the best of both.

Subject:  38)  How can I design my own font?

	One way is to use the ""bitmap"" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g.
Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual 
characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate 
them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X 
Journal for more information.
	The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained 
a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.
	An easier way is to use the ""xfed"" client to modify an existing font; a
version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is 
available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], 
possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce
BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.
	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,
XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in
/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed 
[5/91] in export:/contrib. 
	If you are a MetaFont user you can use ""mftobdf"" from the SeeTeX
distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution
is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.
	The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,
a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.
	The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these
tools to modify a font.
	Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is
in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?

	After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, 
installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent
(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp 
$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the 
directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in
that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably 
leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in 
the path.)
	Sometimes your ""xset +fp $dir"" command fails with a BadValue error:
		X Error of failed request:BadValue
			(integer parameter out of range for operation)
		Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)

	This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or
that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The
mention of an ""integer parameter"" in the message is spurious.)

-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file
   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your
   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an
   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. ""xset +fp ~/myfonts"") and
   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.

-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server
   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file
   ""fonts.dir"".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're
   running OpenWindows, look for the file ""Families.list"".  If you can't find
   it, run bldfamily(1).)

-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a
   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for
   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.
   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for
   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work
   for X11Rn.

Subject:  40)  How do I convert a "".snf"" font back to "".bdf"" font?

	A tool called ""snftobdf 1.4"" is part of the bdftools package, which is 
available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from 
crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?

	der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and 
produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be 
used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can 
understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools 
such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail 
from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]
	In addition, the R5 program ""fstobdf"" can produce bdf for any font that
the R5 server has access to.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?

	The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,
but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to
standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file 
contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is 
for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for 
creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers 
which do not use the MIT font scheme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  43)  How do I add "".bdf"" fonts to my DECwindows server?

	The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the "".pcf"" format.
You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc
font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a
performance hit.

Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)
I want to be able to do something like this:
	xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave

	You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the 
same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because 
of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since 
there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, 
neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap 
converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a 
resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for 
use in many of its widgets, however.
[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]

However:
	A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of 
the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick 
(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of 
image formats as a pixmap.

	The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used 
by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by
AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM 
distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write 
routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to
allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information
on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is
available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on 
the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen 
(anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]

	Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()

which you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:

delete ""old"" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which

	This error, which typically goes on to say, ""widget 11004 vs.

your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking 
against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.
	However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the 
X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW
systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, 
and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you

	Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site
which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. 

	However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the
latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file 
xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and 
non-availability of dictionary servers.

Subject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?

	No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not 
""public domain"", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X 
distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.
	Contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by
individual authors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?

The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the 
previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility 
across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, 
details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the 
network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the 
file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.

[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]

The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  57)! Where can I get X11R5 (source and/or binaries)?

Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC-24 tape 
and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from 
Software Center, Technology Licensing Office, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, 28 Carleton Street, Room E32-300, Cambridge MA 02142-1324,
phone: 617-258-8330.

You will need about 100Mb of disk space to hold all of Core and 140MB to hold
the Contrib software donated by individuals and companies. 

PLEASE use a site that is close to you in the network.

Note that the RELEASE notes are generally available separately in the same
directory; the notes list changes from previous versions of X and offer a
guide to the distribution.

Yup.  IRI also granted a great deal of reconstruction of houses and
buildings in war torn areas to Malaysia. Khak too sareshoon, one of the 
only industries we really have is construction, and there are all these
unemployed youth, and they give money to Malaysia to do what Iranians

I don't believe that BA have anything to do with RR.  It's a seperate
company from the RR Aero-Engine company.  I think that the government
own a stake.  Unfortunately they owned a stake of Jaguar too, until
they decided to make a quick buck and sold it to Ford.  Bastards.
This is definitely the ultimate Arthur-Daley government.

I was just reading in PC Magazine that the peripherals in a PC with an
ISA bus can only access 16MB of memory.  Also, that some video cards on
the ISA bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to.  So that
if I wanted to put 16MB of memory on my PC, my video card wouldn't have
anywhere to map it's memory to.

Can someone explain this in more detail.  Is there a way around this

Almost all window managers (twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates) support
escape sequences for it. For your purpose put following into your
.login (if you're using csh or tcsh), for sh you have to modify it.

if ( ""$term"" == ""xterm"" ) then
	echo ""^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}^G^[]1;${HOST}^G""
endif

Note, ^[ stands for <Esc>, in vi you can enter it by pressing
Ctrl-V and the <Esc>. Same for ^G, it means Ctrl-G. In vi:
press Ctrl-V and then Ctrl-G.
The first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second
in the icon.

BTW, you can also put the current working directory in the
title bar if you make an alias for cd:

alias cd 'cd \!* ; echo ""^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}: ${cwd}^G""'

greetings,
Thomas

FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to
what the group is for......


A note to the users of alt.psychoactives....

This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for
the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc),
antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and
so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate
into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the
serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have
left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through
hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.

It was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of
the above mentioned.

Oh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decided
to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old
nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.

I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it
being moderated...too bad.

Oh well, obviously, no one really cares.

Bill Claussen


Would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group?

I don't think the 550 sold very well - most North Americans who ride a standard
rather than a sport bike usually want something bigger. People walk into the
dealership, look at the 550 and the 750 and say, ""I might as well spring the
extra bucks for the bigger engine.""

Peter,  there's a radiosity package ahead. The only problem is: there 
are a few miles to sail ... ;-^

Let's be serious... I'm working on a radiosity package, written in C++.
I would like to make it public domain.  I'll announce it in c.g. the minute
I finished it. 

That were the good news. The bad news: It'll take another 2 months (at least) 
to finish it. 

In the meantime you may have a look at the file
  Radiosity_code.tar.Z
located at
  compute1.cc.ncsu.edu

(there are some other locations; have a look at archie to get the nearest)

Hope that'll help.

Yours

Stephan

Owen only has one error so far, I believe.  That seriously
underrepresents the harm he has done in the field.

Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches.  He will have a fine
fielding percentage, like always.  The problem is that he doesn't
reach anything that isn't hit straight at him!

This wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to
Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura.  But the third baseman for the Yankees
is Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!

I've only seen one game, Abbott's first start, but there were three
balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality
defensive players.  Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott.

Cheers,
-Valentine

The Clipper Chip will have no effect.  Current generation PCs, portable

Not even a big deal, but it will pass muster if the have a way

Now, I say that it is clear that Dorthy Denning has been functioning

It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a
case of violence by teenagers...

For a little perspective:

How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local
agencies to help children, seniors, the homeless?

Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring
breaks helping out in inner city areas? What about the hundreds of
volunteers ( teenagers and others) who worked to clean up the mess
after the Rodney King riots in LA?

Have you gone to your local high school play recently? Attended the
school orchestra performances? Have you seen how many kids volunteer
to pick up trash, plant trees, do walk-a-thons? How many kids have
tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to? How
many girl scout cookies have you bought? How many chocolate bars for
good causes?

The media picks up on all the anomalies, the sensational...

What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at
school, get good grades, go to college (or to work) and make a real
contribution to our society?

All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives! Mother Theresa
was a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer.

It is really sad to see so many people who buy the sensational
reporting of the media as some kind of reflection of the world today!
It is a reflection of what is happening on the outer fringes of our
society and nothing more...

	While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal
agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order, there is 
still a good point here.  Local law enforcement will be unable to perform
a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possibly
incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only the
FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems
to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This moves
a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.
	The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade
people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  A
national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political 
viewpoints.

I just talked to a rep for my AT&T mastercard regarding this:  There is no
maximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the 
item needs repair.  If it can't be repaired, you get the amount you paid
for it.
Curiously though, the AT&T Gold mastercard has a limit of $1000 on claims.
Definitely not upgrading to that card...:)

I have a request for those who would like to see Charley Wingate
respond to the ""Charley Challenges"" (and judging from my e-mail, there
appear to be quite a few of you.)  

It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or
unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between
the last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or
more posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.  

It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions
will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the
subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I
would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers,
in the following manner:

1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the
Challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he
refuses to do so.

--or--

2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within it
something similar to the following:

    ""Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges.""

Really, I'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, I just want some
honest answers.  You wouldn't think that honesty would be too much to
ask from a devout Christian, would you?  

Nevermind, that was a rhetorical question.

I pointed out the secession movement in Aceh which has also been
brutally dealt with in the past by the Indonesian government.  The
harshly with all secessionist movements.
the evidence, it appears to me that the Indonesian government has dealt
very harshly with all secession movements.

I know that the head of the Indonesian armed forces for a very long time
was Benny Murdani -- a ""Christian"".  Indonesia has been heavy handed in
East Timor for a long time , even when Murdani was head of the armed
forces.  The people who make up the
Indonesian government are in general motivated by national interests,
not religious ones.

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it
is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all
not to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this
bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y
coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy,
and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the
""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                2


""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper court or other legal
          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



                                3

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
(""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.

Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?

A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a
     false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper
     Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products.

I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were
system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen - it freezes.

I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at
startup.

I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured
twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't
afford to be without my Duo at this time.

Anyone out there with these same problems?

This is taken a little out of context and I'm not flaming Jason...it's just
that this was the proverbial straw....

I grow a little weary of the allegations (here, the media, people on the
street) that the BD's had all these ""horrible illegal weapons and other
paraphenalia of destruction capable of blowing tanks 50 feet into the air...""
and then, without missing a beat, discuss how the BD's willfully commited
mass suicide, or killed their own less fanatical and *then* commited mass
suicide, etc., etc.

If the BD's had all these things and intended to ""blow up their abode, blow up
Waco, blow up the entire country, or whatever suits your fancy, what happened
to all the violence they were supposed to unleash? Why wouldn't they have ""gone
out in the proverbial blaze of glory"" and ""come out shooting"" with an attitude
of ""let's take as many of those dogs as possible with us""?

Instead, they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was in
store for them at the government's hands.

It's totally immaterial whether they were all crazy, all fanatics, all followers
of the antichrist, haters of the government, practicers of weird lifestyles, or
whatever...they must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncing
their beliefs, however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to ""you
and me"". There is much precedent for such devotion to cause.

My conclusion at this point is that the ""authorities"" seriously misread their
danger to society (else why did the BD's not do as suggested above) and/or chose
this incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda, up to
and including AG J. Renbo using this as an opportunity to assert her manhood.

Some people really do believe it is better to die than be subjected to what
they perceive as the godless government. When I force myself to not judge
others by my own personal standards and beliefs, I can almost admire their
stand.

I surely believe in the Constitution but I don't know that I have such strength
of conviction as evidenced by the BD's.

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from
a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels
synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable
contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no
visible contrast bands.

To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255
different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,
etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these
frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote
directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.

Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print. Who'd have guessed?

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or
some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had
elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them
did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal
Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue
and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that
some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.

Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively
swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's
nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the
syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The
disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers
on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:
psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --
maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental
toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of
these.

There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try
different things, some of which seem to help.

Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.
Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.

Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)
diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good
doc.

Obviously, it wouldn't be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly 
introducing another.  Cancer mestastizes.  My imperfect understanding of 
the facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard. 
I haven't done the research on it, but I don't recall ever hearing of a 
case of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion.  Probably just a 
common sense kind of arbitrary precaution.  Transmissable diseases like 
malaria though are obviously another story.

If Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e is in Jovian orbit, and if the comet
is still hanging around when Galileo arrives, then I'm sure it will
be added to the list of targets.  We'll have by then over two years
of Earth-based observations to help narrow down the positions of the
pieces of the comet. It probably won't be too much different than
what was done with Gaspra.

Galileo did not image Toutatis.  That came from Earth-based radar.

Me, too... RBI are a worthless stat. Of course, so is stolen bases because 
sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. And of
course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases,
so batting average, slugging and obp out, too.  Hmmm... i guess homers would
not count then, either.
My point? RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. And no stat (or lack
of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. Maybe no stat CAN tell me,
either, but some people are... I just know it!!! 8)

"From: mangoe@cs.umd.edu (Charley Wingate)
Subject: Re: Was Jesus Black?
Lines: 45

This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to
_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone
complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the
contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads
is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the
famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.
The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that
Nefertiti was ""a beautiful black queen.""  This set off an exchange of
hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had
an article from an Egyptologist titled ""Was Cleopatra Black?""  (The answer
to the title is ""no""-- she was greek.)

I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I
personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in
Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary
enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark
hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and
down the Mediterranean.

(Also, if what I remember is correct, the ""Black Madonna"" doesn't represent
a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe
Buehler....?)

In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that
greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,
the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,
or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about
the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then
there are the Ethiopians....

Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these
people are ""white"" (i.e., of the racist's ""race"").  If I may risk a
potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the
identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering
the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval
antisemitism on the other, I don't think that this ""Jesus was white"" thesis
ever played the roles that some hold it did.

Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems
awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.

rep. declined the bet, probably because he knew that 3DO players are
already in pre-production manufacturing runs, 6 months before the
commercial release date.

By the time of commercial release, there will be other manufacturers of
3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production.  Chip
sets will be in full production.  The number of software companies
designing titles for the box will be over 300.

How do I know this?  I was at a bar down the road from 3DO headquarters
last week.  Some folks were bullshitting a little too loudly about
company business.

I was a cryptologic tech in the US Navy (CTRSN, nothing big).  All 'spooks'
in the Navy are required to know the ""gist"" of ""USSID 18"", the Navy-way of
naming a particular Presidential ""Executive Order"".  It outlines what spooks
can and can't do with respect to the privacy of US nationals.

The following information is (of course) UNCLASSIFIED.

The whole issue hangs about what you mean by ""wiretap"".  If the signal can
be detected by ""non-intrusive"" means (like radio listening), then it may be
recorded and it may be ""analyzed"".  ""Analyzed"" means that it may be either
deciphered and/or radio-location may be used to locate the transmitter.

The catch is this:  Any and all record of the signal and its derivatives
may only be kept for a maximum of 90 days, after which they are destroyed
unless permission is obtained from the US Attorney General to keep them.

Didn't you ever wonder how Coast Guard cutters *find* those drug-runners
in all those tens of thousands of square miles of sea, even in the dark?!?

               Rules to the ACME hockey playoff pool 
 
Critierias
 Pick 9 forwards  ( as long as they are forwards LW=RW=C is okay)
 Pick 6 defensemen
 ( arrange them in a lines, 3 forwards and two defense = 1 line 
 ( and arranged them in line order , which of your players would       
 ( play in the first line and which plays in the second line 
 Pick 1 designated playmaker   
      ( can be any positions...try a defensemen )
 Pick 1 designated scorer ( can be any positions )
 Pick 1 goal-tender
 Pick a team   ( the one you think may win the cup )           
                 
 *note: players can only be chosen once !
 ie Cannot have Sakic as forward and again as designated passer
 -----------------------------------------------------------------        
                 
 Calculation of points: 
  ( except for designated scorer and playmaker)
   1 assist  = 1 pt   IXI  1 goal = 1 pt  II 
   ( for players in line 1, their pt totals will be *2 )
          line 1 = pts * 2
          line 2 = pts * 1.5
          line 3 = pts * 1
   1 win     = 2 pt  ( for goalies)
   
   The team that wins the Cup = 10 pts
   
For the designated playmaker         Designated
Calculation will be as follows       Scorer:Goal    = 3 pts
Every goal scored = 0.5 points             Assists = 0.5 pts
Every assists     = 2 points
   
  In the event of a tie, the tie will be broken by unmodified 
  Goal totals and then by game winning goals
  ----SAMPLE-------------------------------------
   eg designated scorer = Jeremy Roenick
      Actual: G=12, A=10, Pts=22  Modified G=(12*3) + A=(10*0.5) = 41
   .    
       designated playmaker = Steve Smith
      Actual: G=1,  A=11, Pts=12  Modified G=(1*0.5)  + A=(11*2) = 22.5
   .
   line 1 = J Murphy(24)- G Courtnall(14)- M Messier(14)
                   Dave Manson(12)-  Iafrate(7)
       Total points = 142 points for that line!

Is anyone familiar with a virus that infects the WINHELP.EXE file?

I have recently noticed some unusual system behavior and ran
Norton AntiVirus for WINDOWS.  It indicated a possible unknown
virus in the WINHELP.EXE file in both the MWINDOWS and WINOS2
directories.  Neither file changed since I installed my OS/2

Any information about this possible virus and suggestions on

I donot know about you, but it makes full sense to me.
Israelis are being killed because Israel is occupying , Let israel withdraw
and israeli blood will be saved. It isNOT the palestineans who undermined
the right of life of israelis, but it is israel which occupied and exposed 
the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of 1967 !

More generally, the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada,
and i had previously posted a ""long"" article about this issue, whom i finished
by an open question:
Suppose the Intifada stops, What is the motive for Israel to withdraw ?
donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit. Everybody in the world looks
and hopes for peace, so why isnot there any. hope of peace is necessary
but not sufficient motive.

As for the Arabian countries, their problems are an Arabian concern. 
the Arabian people can deal with it themselves, if the west doesnot intervene.
As for Serbs, I donot think that those FUCKED UP RAPISTS (excuse my language
but it really hurts as much if I was in Bosnia itself) areNOT humans. Those
surely came from outer space or something. No human can allow himself
to see such attrocities than to participate in.

My definition is the same as yours, but one has to look into the world politics.
In politics, a ""solution"" doesNOT imply ""JUST solution"".

It seems that it was problem in the definition of ""solution"".
I think a solution must be just, because otherwise it would never be lasting.
However, when politicians say a solution, they donot mean a just solution but 
just a solution.

Dear Will,

I've never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok.
I had a few thoughts!:

""Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead"" - James 2:17

Faith is both belief and action.
If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a
swimmer? and will people believe that I am?
Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a
Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to
God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!

In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6
v3 says ""We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands""
I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have
come to know Him, then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and
we cannot help but obey what He says.
I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing
us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically
produced in our lives.

Hope this helps.

-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!

Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the
""well regulated malitia.""  Here is what is says about its character:

	 To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes
	 of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through
	 military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to
	 acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the
	 character of a well-regulated militia, 

It also talks about the ""well regulated militia"" having a nationally
uniform in structure and disipline.  

I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:

    	Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with
	respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed
	and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it
	will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of
	a year.

But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large
group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people
every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can
be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it 
requires a continually standing committee of organizers.  

Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and
disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim
a ""well regulated militia"" is not well organized.  But I will concide 
a ""well organized militia"" is not necessarily a ""well regulated militia."" 

Several people have stated that the ""well organized militia"" is
what is defined under 10 USC 311, which states

	The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied 
	males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in 
	section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, 
	or who have made a declaration of intention to become, 
	citizens of the United States and of female citizents of 
	the United States who are commissioned officers of the 
	National Guard.

This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective ""well regulated.""
10 USC 311 does not define a ""well regualed militia"" in any way, shape, 
or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia
The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the ""well regualed militia"" as a
proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it
talk above ""disciplining all the militia of the United States"" so they
fit the ""character of a well-regulated militia.""  This is what the
paragraph states about the associated costs:

	It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor 
	of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the 
	present numbers of the people, would not fall far short 
	of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all 
	the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the 
	mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,
	would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not 
	succeed, because it would not long be endured.


Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is:
James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General Welfare"" clause): 
	""Nothing is more natural nor common than first
	to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a
	recital of particulars.""

So the phrase ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall 
not be infringed"" must either qualify or explain the phrase ""a well 
regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.""  
The definition of ""explain"" as stated in ""The American Hertitage
Dictionary of the Enlish Language"" The New College Edition, 1982 is:
	1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;
	   elucidate: ""It was the economists who undertook to explain 
	   this puzzle""
	2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.
	3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:
	   explain an error
The second phrase clearly does not ""explain"" the first, therefore
the second phrase must ""qualify"" the first.  The definition given
for ""qualify"" is:
	1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities
	   of; characterize.
	2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or 
	   task.
	3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.
	4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.
	5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate
	6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)
Since ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed"" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and
it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.
By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since
#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it
must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, ""the right 
of the people to keep and bear Arms"" gives legal power to the ""well 
regualated militia"" and this legal power ""shall not be infringed"".  

I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more 
evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the 
people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little 
about the right of an untrained person to ""keep and bear"" a .50 caliber
machine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm
(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun
safety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine
gun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with
me.

-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy
-> our Liberties and Rights.

I mean ""to destory our Liberties and Rights.""  Is that why a participate
in the discussion of exactly what ""our Libertues and Rights"" are?  I 
force my version of ""our Liberties and Rights"" by begining statements
of what ""our Liberties and Rights"" with ""All that the Second Amendment 
clearly states to me.""   Using expressions, such as ""states to me,"" 
clearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.

So in effort not to force my views and not ""to destory our Liberties and
Rights,""  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in
the matter of ""Liberties and Rights"" is the final word.  For I am only
one person among many and the final word on ""Liberties and Rights"" cleary
and irrevocably belongs to the many.

OK, just for grins:
- Kekule hypothesized a resonant structure for the aromatic benzene
ring after waking from a dream in which a snake was swallowing his tail.
- Archimedes formalized the principle of buoyancy while meditating in
his bath.

In neither case was there ""no connection to prior theories, concepts, etc.""
as you stipulated above. What there was was an intuitive leap beyond
the current way of thinking, to develop ideas which subsequently proved
to have predictive power (e.g., they stood the test of experimental
verification).

Is Kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an M-16
from an AR-15?  That he can see the difference between a semi-auto and
a full-auto UZI?  That he can see the difference between the various
versions (some full-auto, some semi-auto only) of the M-11/9?

If so, I'd love to hear the details, if only because they'll demonstrate
that Kratz is blowing smoke.

Considering that one can design a gun so that it looks just like
another gun, yet have very different properties, and that that's
quite common....

Most kids in my neighborhood were quite young when they figured out
that my parents car wasn't much like Richard Petty's, even though it
looked just like it (except for the paint job).  Things must have been
different with Kratz.

>Sure it's on TV but why does that make a difference?

No, it doesn't, but that's irrelevant.  If visual inspection of the
outside worked, TV would be acceptable, but since it doesn't, the fact
that it's just as good as seeing in person doesn't mean much.

The proper spelling is Kirlian. It was an effect discoverd by

As I recall, the coronas visible are ascribed to static discharges

halides in the films.

Hi,
    I was reading through ""The Spaceflight Handbook"" and somewhere in
there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them
when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to
the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he
estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not
be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published
in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very
long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in
fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of
course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?
Can this be extended to larger accelerations?

Thanks is advance...

I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something
much more elementary.

Every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and
an initial directory.

If you have a small disk (50 meg or less), I would recommend that it remain
a single partition. Unless you have some other consideration.

If you have a large disk (greater than 200 meg), multiple partitions can
make sense.

IMO, the Royals don't have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae
suddenly began channeling for John McGraw.  OK, they have some decent
pitchers.  But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind
and McReynolds and McRae and an over-the-hill Brett, you're not going
to finish .500 unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him.

I'd say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck.

	Nonsense.  First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water
(that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the
cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes 
through the cooling tower).  Third, liquid uranium would burst
into flame on contact with air.

No one else seems to know, so I'll post this.

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion
flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.
They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is
that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as
hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman
constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out
of kilter, and you get sick and die.

I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real
life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this
book, I would imagine you would have to:

1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy
   water.

2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other
   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.

During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and
eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the
poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the
water the victim ingested was heavy.

You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both
alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly
begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the
heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real
story here.

Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was
no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.

The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids
would literally be ""heavy"".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and
heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by
about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe
the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that
the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test
involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

Paul.

I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to
Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage
says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the
Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho
for Jesus and may be authentic.
   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which
lack the references.

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but
I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes
this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus.)

To Andi,

I have to disagree with you about the value of Israeli news sources. If you
want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news
directly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to some
extent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. However, 
the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the ""truth"" and to discern 
the bias. 

Go read or listen to some Israeli media. You will learn more news and more
opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so. Then you can form your own
opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't 
change.

On Ted Koppel last night, the ubiquitous Australian woman claimed that

cyanide or by putting a gun in their mouth.  With cyanide on hand, why
choose to roast yourself?  There are too many unanswered questions here.

  greetings:
  you may be in luck.  i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of
the kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a
mould (sp?) off a real kubel, and has adapted it to the beetle
floorpan.  as for the suspension, all i can remember about the
vw thing i used to own is that it had about 3"" more suspension
travel than a stock beetle, but i'd heard that there were after-
market parts for off-road use that were as good or better.  note
that the major difference (looks wise) between a kubel & a thing
are the hood and the fenders.  the kubel had an external spare
mounted *on* the hood, and the hood sloped down (for visibility?)
sharply, and had rounded fenders.  the thing has a lightly sloped 
hood with the spare mounted inside (unless moved to make for more
luggage space...) and has half-hexagon shaped fenders (imagine a
nut large enough to put a tire *in*, and cut off the bottom half
of it...).
  unfortunately, i don't have that info anymore.  try stopping
at a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the
two big mag's and calling them.  they might be able to get the
number for you (don't forget to calculate the time difference to
norway before calling...).

later,
kc

	I think I have updated info on this.  My understandingis that
former officer Cranston approached a teenager who was being questioned
by another officer.   Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the head
with a heavy police flashlight, causing a significant, though not
life-threatening.  THere is no evidence that Teenager A was
doing anything threatening at the time.  Teenager A was released
on bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer
Cranston.  The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an 
investigation into the use of excessive force.  
	The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have 
happened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranston
refused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home
 to get it.  Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be
a cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint
against him.
	A few days afterward, Cranston allegedly walked into 
Wilson's Garage, where Teenager A and friends were known to
hang out and work on cars as a hobby.  Cranston fatally shot
Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C.  Teenager D was shot once
in the shoulder/chest.  Teenager E was working under the car
and was not noticed by Officer Cranston.  Teenager D went to a home
and summoned police, who went to Wilson's Garage and found the 
3 corpses and one unscathed survivor.

	A few days after his arrest, Officer Cranston attemped
to commit suicide in his cell.

Ah, there's the rub.  And a catch-22 to boot.  For the purposes of a
contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get
there.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without
demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a
low priced system existed, there might be demand...  

I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage
low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably
be the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to
'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...

This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other
words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,
navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. 
You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I'd hate to see
folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch
system comes on line.

I guess I'd simplify this to say that 'waste' is a slippery concept.  If
your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its
not 'wasted' money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500
million, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.

xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window (previous versions were limited to vertical text). Rotation  
is still achieved using XImages, but the notion of rotating a whole font
first has been dropped.

What's new?

I've added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings - thus
speeding up redraws.

Where can I get it?

According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any
utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it. 

For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 doesn't offer
much. You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create, however. :-)

It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem, and have
given up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what
keys it will accept, and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun
from my HP, and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not
sufficient, or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work.
However, I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work,
and I do some customised things with them.

Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem, and I am using exactly
the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.

It's irritating when someone mis-labels ""us"" as ""fundamentalists"",
isn't it?  This sort of thing may help us understand why some muslims 
rather resent being put under this label.

The Quadralink by AE is a possibly problematical solution to your needs.
I've used one for the last 4 (?) years on my personal system, but a fatal
bug has crept into their more recent s/w. The bug only shows up during
heavy serial traffic but completely crashes the system (MacsBug can not
reboot, time to hit the restart button).

AE told me in January that they were aware of and working on fixing the bug
which I described to them. Since then they have not answered any of my
faxes asking them for a status of the bug-fix.

The QL has been great, but for now I have mine sidelined. If you are only
going to be using 2400 Baud or less, then you may have no, or very
infrequent problems,

Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...
 
If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:
djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
 
I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have
two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,
I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one
screen.
 
I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within
driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you
don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes
for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction.
 
Details:
 
Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:
---------------------------------------------------
 
**SOLD**
 
Sony 1304 14"" color monitor:
----------------------------
What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,
Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).
It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,
and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.
 
Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not
including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an
offer if that sounds unreasonable.
 
 
RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):
------------------------------------------------------------------
Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13""
monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode
(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a
RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg
SIMMS).
 
Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking
**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and
packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card
together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a ""bundled offer""
for these items.
 
------------
 
Cheers.

			How do I get a DoD number?

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is ""What is the
DoD?"", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be ""How do I
get a DoD number?"" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List
(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling
creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can
make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-
base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not
that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)

Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll
just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.

By now you're probably asking ""So who's the KotL already?"". Well, as
John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real ""secret"" left around
here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,
nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was
the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the
KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely
with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-
oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with ""weenie
mailers""). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a
Dead-Head.

***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************

Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed
work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)
days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of
economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it
just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think
the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).

***********************************************************************

One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what
they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?
The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &
e-mail address. For example:

0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM

(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as
there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)

            ""Denizens of Doom"", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)

      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]

There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal 
things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  
motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  
helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve
seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, 
traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double 
entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They 
argue with each other and plan rides together.

The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, 
although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each 
other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world 
and communicate with each other electronically via computer.

The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  
the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry 
professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, 
rec.motorcycles (pronounced ""wreck-dot-motorcycles,"" it's the file name for 
the group's primary on-line ""meeting place"") carries about 2250 articles per 
month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent 
posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred 
to as the DoD.

The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of 
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer 
enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, ""Denizen 
of Doom.""  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of 
the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of 
course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.

The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules 
appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the 
List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been 
almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and 
Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Norway and Finland.

Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run 
of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the 
American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- 
selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a 
few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were 
donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 
to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs 
in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.

As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go 
riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's 
""Silicon Valley.""  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on 
Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California 
""Joust.""

The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big 
barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern 
California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, 
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan 
for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction 
with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.

Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective 
communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional 
motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to 
get together.  Long may they flame.


""Live to Flame -- Flame to Live""	[centerbar]

This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do 
anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as ""flames"";  
issuing them is called ""flaming.""  Flames often start when a member 
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A 
typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be 
something like:  ""What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad 
poseur!""  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding 
ability and your cat.

          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_

                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011

Periodically the question ""What is DoD?"" is raised. This is one of
those questions in the same class as ""Why is the sky blue?"", ""If there
is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?"" and ""Why do
women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
dump you?"", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,
and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the
halls of academe for generations. 

A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on
a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two
machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but
who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and
signed it ""The Denizen of Doom"". Not wishing to identify himself, he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. 

He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was
the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty
easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership
number. 

Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized
electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a
gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members. 

In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet
feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized
and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list
(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating
around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by
#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and
distributed on VHS by #18)! 

Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,
placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine
management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?
Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. 

The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only
ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which
includes name, state, and email address. 

The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name). 

                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live

                      The DoD

              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1
 
Welcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of
all time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? The
Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent
(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of
your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against
you. Read 'em and weep. 

We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible
Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to
Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: 

Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! 

Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW
     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer
     11 but what the heck.  

Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.

Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at
     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!
     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a
     Woosh-a-stream.

Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.

Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???

Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see
     what they say, eh? 

Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.

High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.

Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!

Terrible: B.T.???

Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.

Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.

Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? 

Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.

Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.

Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.

Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!

Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???

Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean 
     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! 

Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.

Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with
Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and
the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! 

Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?

Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?

Heritick: Nahhh.

Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.

Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?

Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!

Muck: What's a carbujector?

Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!

Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!

Dill: Well, where do we race?

Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't
     ride! 

Muck: No! No! Quiet!

Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.
     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!

High: My 9 too!

Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!

Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!

Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more
cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the
infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! 

Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like
     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting
     it up on the ole ventral stand!  

Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and
     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! 

Booster: I hate Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.

Booster: I love Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.

Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?

Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.

Muck: What about a Tridump?

Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?

Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?

Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?

Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.

Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.
Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.

Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.

And Now even more west coasters pour in.
Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!

Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!

Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:
Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.

Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.

More riders from the west coast come into the discussion:
Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.

Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.

With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It
was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. 
Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. 

Muck: Why??

Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.

Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.

Clean: No GOOD!

Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!

Clean: Inferior!

Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys
burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a
thrill... 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? 

Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,
     WILHEM! 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? 

And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the
thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all
boomed out.
G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding
     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. 

All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.

Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding
mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the
next gut wretching episode of ""The Yearning and Riderless"" with its
ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will
be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the
question of: ""To Helmet or Not to Helmet"" will be aired, this is heady
material and viewer discretion is advised.

          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video

                by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94


[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call
Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,
with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] 

(editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens
referring to each other as ""Chuck"". I guess you had to be there. I
wasn't.) 

Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,
 cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,
 may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted
 to live a man's life,
[Music slowly builds in background]
 riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes
 and the deepest valleys,
 living the life of a Motorcyclist;
 doing donuts and evading the police;
 terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;
 eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,

	I Want to be      A Denizen!

[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with
fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of
an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels
sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,
showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil
on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat
Boy.] 

Chuck [Sings to the tune of ""The Lumberjack Song""]:

I'm a Denizen and I'm okay,
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:
He's a Denizen and he's okay,
He flames all night and he rides all day.

I ride my bike;
I eat my lunch;
I go to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays I ride Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus]:
He rides his bike;
He eats his lunch;
He goes to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays he rides Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus refrain]:
'Cause He's a Denizen...

I ride real fast,
My name is Chuck,
It somehow seems to fit.
I over-rate the worst bad f*ck,
But like a real good sh*t.

Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Chorus refrain]:
Oh, He's a Denizen...

I wear high heels
And bright pink shorts,
 full leathers and a bra.
I wish I rode a Harley,
 just like my dear mama.

[Chorus refrain]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    Why you have to be killed.

Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed
to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started
as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.

Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: ""What does DoD
stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?"" Naturally, a
Denizen who had watched the movie ""Top Gun"" a few times too many rose
to the occasion and replied:

""That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.""

And the rest is history.

A variation on the ""security"" theme is to supply disinformation about
what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where
known) include:

Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts
Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters
Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death
Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes

Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     The rec.moto.photo archive

First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck
Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,
and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in
unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not
only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.

Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk
at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the
server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,
the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.

Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how
to use the archive.

**********************************************************

Via ftp:

cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]

Via e-mail:

The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the
message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The
arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For
rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:

dir [dod]
send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif
send [dod]dodframe.ps

and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts
of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.

Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to
the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of
50K each; not a good idea.

**********************************************************

A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so
why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?
Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours (California time). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Patches? What patches?

You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &
pins. And your reaction was probably: ""I want!"", or ""That's sick!"", or
perhaps ""That's sick! I want!""

Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that
there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad
news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't
because of any ""exclusivity"" attempt, but simply because there is no
""DoD store"" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by
individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is
someone says ""I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost
$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?"" Then
orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a
DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all
this is anarchy in action.

Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and
perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),
motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts
(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and
patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by
popular demand].

All ""profits"" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association
Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,
you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of ""Denizens
of Doom, USENET, The World"", complete with a DoD pin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.

~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles
~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>
~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum
~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT

I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,
the other day.

""Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:

Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the
Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is
now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude
to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently
being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to 
see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,
I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank 
you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the
museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

                                Sincerely,


                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395
                                Director

P.S.  Please post on your computer bulletin board.""

As you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally,
it was meant for all of you who purchased DoD goodies that made this
amount possible.

Arnie

            Updated stats & rec.motorcycles rides info

Some of the info cited above in various places tends to be a moving
target. Rather than trying to catch every occurence, I'm just sticking
the latest info down here.

                        Organized (?) Rides:

Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third
year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got
together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north
as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of
North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great
Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]

Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the
Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,
riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal
2-strokes.  And though it's not an ""official"" (as if anything could be
official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races
in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.
European Denizens have staged some gathers too.  (Your ad here,
reasonable rates!)

Not this time, Enis. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped 
with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who 
determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, 
ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. In 
other words, what we have is a demand from the fascist government of
x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our
people.

  Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Republic

  Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these
  lands.""         (Cebbar Leygara - Kurdish Leader - October 13, 1992)

No, currently there's no room for him in the rotation.  Key is having
a Most Impressive April.  Abbott is pitching well.  Perez is back.
Wickman has pitched his way into the rotation, and is holding his spot
with an outstanding performance his last time out.  And Kamieniecki
isn't doing too poorly himself.

If the Yankees find themselves in need of a starter, Militello will
get another chance.  Until then, he'll have to wait in line.

	I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence 
and support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for 
each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require 
different levels of evidence.

	As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one 
may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans. 
One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The 
only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the 
individual always wear business suits, etc.

	The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the 
claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the 
level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the 
consequences of the proposition are.



	If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain 
why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between 
two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their 
distance apart. 

	Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then
we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the 
consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of 
affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law, 
they are irrelevent when theorizing about the ""Truth"" of the law.

	Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including 
the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of 
affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find
""The Truth""?



	By the way, what is ""Truth""? Please define before inserting it in 
the conversation. Please explain what ""Truth"" or ""TRUTH"" is. I do think that 
anything is ever known for certain. Even if there IS a ""Truth"", we could 
never possibly know if it were. I find the concept to be meaningless.

The IIIP has just been superseded by the 4M, which is the one I am using at

Jesus also recognized other holy days, like the Passover.  Acts 15 says 
that no more should be layed on the Gentiles than that which is necessary.
The sabbath is not in the list, nor do any of the epistles instruct people
to keep the 7th day, while Christians were living among people who did not
keep the 7th day.  It looks like that would have been a problem.

Instead, we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike
(Romans 14:5) and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of
food we eat, Jewish holy days we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath. (Col. 2.)

>The

I don't think that the Sabbath, or any other command of the law is totally
irrelevant to modern Christians, but what about Collosions 2, where it says
that we are not to be judged in regard to the keeping of the sabbath?

Subject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conception?
Organization: trunking_fixed
Lines: 111

Note: I am cross-posting (actually, emailing) this to 
bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to 
soc.religion.christian.

[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about
the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification
up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]

There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the
mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the ""Annunciation"" by
Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28

 And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
 a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a
 man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's
 name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _""Hail,
 thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed
 art thou among women.""_

Now, now, hold that line of thought - ""the Lord is with Mary &
blessed art thou among women"" - while you read on....

In the book, ""First Lady of the World, A Popular History of
Devotion to Mary"" by Peter Lappin:

The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated
than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible
that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title ""The Conception
of Saint Anne"", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of
a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,
just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in
emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle
of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary
is the incorruptible timber ""out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_
of Christ's sinless body""; she is ""God's Eden, in whom there is
no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.""  Her perfect
beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her
purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,
she was hailed as ""innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,
spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from
among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve"".
...
At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,
John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a 
greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all
sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.
...

Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.
From ""Pocket Catholic Cathechism"" by John A. Hardon:

Baptism -
Concupiscence Remains after Baptism.
Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized
but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to
injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of
Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).

Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:
In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first
parents were originally gifted three times over:
-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the
 power to think and to choose freely.
-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality
 and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.
-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,
 the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding
 title to enter heaven.
By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and
preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without
losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose
freely.

Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's
sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts
but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our
bodies on the last day...

Going back to _Immaculate Conception_
(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other
books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):

Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a
non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born 
AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but
STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:
""Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.
Blessed art thou amongst women"".

Even Mary was confused about this greeting.

Mary could very well have possessed all of the
_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first
parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):
    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)
    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)
    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would
                definitely want to be with those He
                has made _blessed_)
    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)

At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace
and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body
of Christ and so,

Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still
has maintained her Immaculate Heart.

Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably
includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially
documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.

I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data
structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they
came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they
won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,
there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime
movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and
transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't
matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.

I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,
and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What
other patents does Apple have on the Mac?

In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of, I think their
cost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. If nothing else, a working SSTO
is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as
much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G
range.

True it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I
don't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the
risks involved.

If you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures
100% of the available launch market, then I think you could
do it.

Still living in an alternate universe? Numerous articles in major newspapers 
(London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested 
the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the 
Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to 
deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his 
deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt 
obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history.
Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control' 
or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger 
Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration 
as deplorable but insignificant.[1]

 Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately 
 forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi 
 collaboration.

 A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft
 is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The 
 magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany
 and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the
 magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,
 is attention-getting.

 This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically
 important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be
 an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. 

 In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain
 political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They 
 occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.
 The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered 
 ""Aryan"" and what befell them.

Now wait, there is more.

Okay, I've received a whole lot of requests for the movie, so for
simplicity's sake I can't mail out any more than I've already received (as
of 16:30 EDT, Tuesday).  Maybe it'll pop up on a site sooner or later.

You don't know much about modern automatic weapons, do you?  Just about ANYBODY
with basic manufacturing skill can turn out HIGH QUALITY submachineguns.  A 
couple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building 
submachineguns in the school shop.

I suggest that you go to the library and find a copy of ""Smallarms of the 
World"".  Your entire premise is based on non-factual assumptions.

First by his fruits.  The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven
on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of
original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the
connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace
based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation
of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God,
the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of
restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all
the World's religions.

Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may
miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000
years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish
people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that
John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was
Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even
questioned who Jesus was: ""is he the one who is to come or do we look
for another"". (see book of Matthew)

David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like
this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real
Messiah when he does show up.

Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for
Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?

The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is
that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but
achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born
sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God
thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God
originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not
complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's
representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one
God.

Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.

Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I 
would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The
older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would
assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some
if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.

Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study.
My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have
independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and
more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The
independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy
the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second
difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm
not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive
system. The older Landcruisers have a ""lock-up"" type. Both have their
advantages and disadvantages.

My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument
against extra-marital sex -- one which I personally believe has some
truth.  My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a
_plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At this
stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or
anything like that, just that it is plausible.  To try to convince you
all of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot
of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to
gather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.  

Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is ""a prime cause""
(in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychological
problems, especially depression, in Western societies.  I am not saying
it is ""the prime cause"" or ""the only cause"", just ""a prime cause"" --
i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think when
you say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- I
admit that there are probably other factors, but I do think that
extra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the family)
is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like
depression in Western society this century.

       I've read about more than a few of these programs that ran into
problems in convincing parents to get their children immunized even
when they were delivered to their doorstep.  (I don't know, maybe
that sheet they have to be informed of about possible risks, side-
effects, and bad reactions scares them.)

Sorry, guy, you got it wrong.  ATF was pumping tear gas into the compound.
The Branch Davidians (going along with their apocolyptic faith) set their
own compound on fire killing all but 9 or so.  No children survived.

1. Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different
   TSR programs.

2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.

3. Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster.

4. You can disable disconnect and get some kB/s but just to loose the mouse
   or other int`s when diskaccesing.

(I get 2.3MB/s with DX50 LB and SCSI LB and Maxtor LXT340SY - Coretest)

I've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep

(Detroit, April 19)

In a development that shocked most knowledgable observers, the Detroit Redwings
scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en
route to a 6-3 win over the best team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs. 

The Leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferior
Detroit squad and clearly deserved to win. Only the biased officiating of
Andy Van Hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on
the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior 
visiting side prevented an all-out massacre of the Wings by the league's best

I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in
this thread.  In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand
on two of her comments.

In article <C5JoDH.9IG@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes:

One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning
about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,
scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of
evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the
back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be
filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a
grave mistake to confuse these.

Past snippets from this thread:

>>> I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....

>> He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would
>> distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from
>> one in which it does not. ...

Back to Lee Lady:

> These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and
> sci.psychology.  According to these posters  ""If it's not supported by
> carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.""

These posters are making the mistake that I have previously
criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A ""carefully
designed and controlled study"" is neither always possible nor
always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a
remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we
have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind
of claim to ask for a ""carefully designed and controlled study""
to alleviate our skepticism.)

Rules such as ""support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and
controlled study"" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.
I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be
convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have
occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To
reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from
uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical
problems are notoriously problematic.)

Sounds about right.

If there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to
aggresively cut prices.  Once the demand fall off a bit, then is the
time to start getting aggressive with pricing.  Waiting too long can
really hurt your business though :-)

The PowerBooks have sold very well up to now, if they are slowing
down Apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions (the
only reason I own a PowerBook is that I could spring for a $900 PB100,
the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me).  I'd bet they'll
be coming out with more power versions too.

Wrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the
people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are
there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority
could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.
and it would fly using the logic above.

When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,
there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis
is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those
who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a
majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting
the hangee.

What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the
limitations on the government, probably because they know that the
people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind
tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has
been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just
shows how gullible the people have become to ""I am from the government
and am here to help you sort of line"".  We have been lied to, fed
half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control
laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on
force, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able
to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch
of elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.  The Founding Fathers
sure as hell didn't, either.

	The majority of the discussion involving this ""Clipper Chip"" seems to
	pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone
	know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
	signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.

I'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect
to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  There would
be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper
any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption
front end on it.

There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely
a digital chip.  The back end will come later, but I'm *positive* it won't
be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation
scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.

The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones.

As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  ""multi-headed""
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display).  ""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
""multi-screen"" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

""zaphod"" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
inherent to X.

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing
about X.

So, will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade, or will it 
require a logic board swap? It would be interesting for Apple to come out with
a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's 680x0, like RocketShare. But I 
guess that's getting a bit fantastic!

I was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' with
PowerPCs on a NuBus card.

Also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? Last I heard, the 
estimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. I
heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines
at a much earlier date that Q1 94, but I doubt it's true.

Finally, is the PowerPC developer's CD 'mini-course' available? I saw it 
advertised in the developer's university calendar, and I'd like to know if it's
at all *interesting*.

Check with the local fire department.  My buddy is a firefighter and they
have these small map books which are Amazing!  They are compact, easy to
use (no folding).  They even have a cross reference section in which you
match your current cross streets with the cross streets you want to go to
and it details the quickest route.  They gave me an extra they had laying
around.  But then again I know all those people I'm not really sure if they
are supposed to give/sell them. (The police may also have something
similar).

Well put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this
growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the
investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from
any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been
behind it.  What's going on here?

Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.
I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops
because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business
negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR
knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a
psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had
professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was
emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from
civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their
isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious
orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as
the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being
consumed in the apocalypse.

IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated
psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of
action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly
appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the
tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.
They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,
obstensibly to perform ""gas insertions"" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push
him over the edge.

Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV
earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical
role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno
on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)
claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true
they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they
were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and
reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at
the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and
would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the
""gas insertion"" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image
that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back
and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.

Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without
bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency
interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation
of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.

The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,
abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the
armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited
his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A
simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell
how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not
have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the
compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the
FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the
revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without
all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to
show the world how big her balls are.

Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my 
very soul.

I think some essential information must be missing here, i.e., you must be
suffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression.  There is
no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy
person.  The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms, and may
even help prevent the development of post-herpetic neuralgia, but I
certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason.

To address your more general question, IV therapy does provide higher and
more consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug.  For treating a
serious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is
getting adequate drug levels.

First, thanks to all who replied to my original question.

I've implemented the ideas from the article above and I'm very satisfied
with the results. I needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine.
In some cases (generating offset curves) loops can occur. I now have a
fast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop. Although
I did not follow the article above strictly. The check if the fourth control
point lies in the the loop area, which is bounded by two parabolas and
one ellips is too complicated. Instead I enlarged the loop-area and
surrounded it by for straight lines. The check is now simple and fast and
my approximation routine never ever outputs self-intersecting bezier curves
again!

I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.
I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the
Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:
(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or
(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with
XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?

All help appreciated...thanks!

Actually, I was simply relaying the reasoning of this so-called genius BW

Next time, before you say something foolish, be aware what you are responding

A good point.  What helps to keep such things going is the public
attitude that one should have ""faith""""; that some authority from
on high should not be subjected to mere reason.  Couple this with a
variety of personality quirks, mojor and minor mental illnesses, and
ego of would-be leaders, and you get all the variety of cults and

Well, I also have an LC III.  Popping the top revealed:

	One ""socket"" for an additional VRAM SIMM

	One ""socket"" for a 72-pin RAM SIMM

	One socket for a flat-pack FPU

	A processor-direct slot (PDS) identical to the LC/LC II, but with
	an additional set of connetions to one side (for the full 32-bit

That's it.  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
in the PDS, but that's the only place.

This sounds a bit high to me.  Still higher accelerations have been endured
*very briefly*, during violent deceleration.  If we're talking sustained
acceleration, I think 30-odd gees has been demonstrated using water immersion.

I doubt that any of this generalizes to another order of magnitude.

Right now, I'm just going to address this point.
When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land,
It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because,
for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin),
living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon.
The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of
it.   It's called commerce.  The owners, however, made no 
provisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting 
them by selling the land right out from under them.
They are to blame, not the Jews.

    ^^^
How long does he have to take in fixing it?  Does he have to use new
parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your
knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty
but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? 

When it comes to local dealers:

- Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their ""techs"" are
re-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.

- Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.

- Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done
period, unless you are on a paid service contract.

Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a
ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what
I'm talking about. 

I also know the ""local service"" scam that retail computer dealers like
to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers
having been singing for years -- ""Buy from me and you'll get good
service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition
and you'll be sorry if you need service."" 

Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order
companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, 
on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you
good service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good 
service, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point, 
but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.

This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are
any such cases.  I doubt it.  In the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent.
when Aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone
""knew the rules.""  Today, when you can't count on people knowing even
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric, a good argument is
often indistinguishable from a poor one.

As of yet, there has been no description of the general principles
behind the Clipper proposal. For example, is this a public key system
or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the
system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and
not the person).

Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks.
I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks
and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic.
I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system,
but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by 
giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the 
real 80-bit key.

You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such.

From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together
over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated
type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together
from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would

I read this in an article in ""The Australian Muslim Times"", the
newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.  

If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if
they see this posting) can elaborate.

I don't deny this fact.

The thrust of my argument here is that 

(a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found
guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is
wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.

(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps
have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is
_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and
_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important 
distinction.

I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say ""Muslim"".  In
general, anyone who calls themselves a ""Muslim"" and does not do or 
outwardly profess
something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam
is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to
Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a
Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential
principles, though, then one does leave Islam.

The term ""Muslim"" is to be contrasted with ""Mu'min"", which means ""true
believer"".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is
something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you
will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,
because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,
for example, am a ""true believer"" or not.  For example, I could just be
putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to
what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say ""Muslims""
we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in
practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By
""Muslim"" we do not necessarily mean ""Mu'min"", or ""true believer"" in
Islam.

Let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues.  As
I've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of 
eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers,
barbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian
agenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits of
allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without
regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be 
free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.  
(As some/many libertarians would argue.)  

On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation
is obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call
for this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any
kind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of 
difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic, 
to say the least.

I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education, 
national defense or local police that suggests a ""free market"" can provide
a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives
than is provided through ""statist"" approaches.   With some notable
exceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile 
analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.

	I have some brand-new shrinkwrapped boxes of 8"" floppy disks that I
would like to sell.  They are all 3M disks:

40 (4 boxes of 10) SS/SD 8"" floppy disks
60 (6 boxes of 10) DS/DD, W/WP 8"" floppy disks

Misco is selling the SS/SD 3M disks for 25.90 for a box of ten and they are
selling the DS/DD 3M disks for 31.90 for a box of ten.  I will take the
best offer I can get for the disks (as many boxes as you want).

	I also have a quantity of 8"" floppy disks that 
some people were getting rid of, probably due to an upgrade to a newer drive
system.  All the disks are used and most have labels on them, but they all 
appear to be in good physical shape.  However, I make no guarantees of the
quality of these disks.  Here are the statistics:

Quantity	Make	Type

10		3M	Single side/Double density,soft sector,128 bytes/record
66		Memorex Single side/Double density,soft sector,128 bytes/record

I will accept the best offer I receive for the disks and I'm willing to sell
them off in different amounts, the minimum being a box of ten (if I get no
offers on these disks I would considering throwing them in with the new
disks I'm selling above). 

I also have a head-cleaning kit for 8"" disk drives for which I will take
the best offer I can get.

All sales are final.

I would prefer to ship COD and add the shipping costs onto the total order 
cost.

Do you mean Juan Berenguer?  He was traded for Mark Davis in the middle
of last season.  Exchanged one stiff for another, as Berenguer hadn't
come back from his injury in 91.  I think he's retired now.

Anyhow, as middle relief, Marvin ain't that bad.  He at least can
pitch a couple of innings or do mop-up work.  I don't know much
about McMichael (was he the Mexican League guy?), but
everybody else in the pen is a 1 inning man, except maybe
Mercker.

                   TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS
	     
	     
                           The Rose Garden 


2:52 P.M. EDT


	     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our 
national deficit and to increase our investment in the American 
people, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget 
plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope 
and opportunity in the country.  
	     
	     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, 
which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed 
the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support 
of a majority of the United States Senate. 
	     
	     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get 
the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a 
fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  
Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate 
have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working 
the will of the majority on the jobs bill.
	     
	     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every 
state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue 
is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking 
for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't 
care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying 
the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the 
table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of 
dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their 
families and drawing a paycheck.
	     
	     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of 
serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our 
economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working 
with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some 
of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs 
plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on 
jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet 
national needs.  
	     
	     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  
Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what 
size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of 
the American people. 
	     
	     But even as we make those reductions and the package 
will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the 
minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is 
the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the 
dramatic rise in violent crime. 
	     
	     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an 
additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities 
to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the 
fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a 
matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as 
10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in 
communities all across our nation.
	     
	     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of 
violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many 
people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their 
homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments 
America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that 
investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  
	     
	     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep 
the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no 
mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I 
ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight 
for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.
	     
	     I want to thank the police officers who are here today 
and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here 
that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to 
rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the 
summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to 
talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement 
concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country 
to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and 
a brighter and more peaceful future.
	     
	     I say what I say today not just because it's good for 
law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in 
these communities.  I have always supported community policing not 
only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, 
but because it cements better relationships between people in law 
enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces 
the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the 
chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.
	     
	     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  
I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put 
another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four 
years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind 
the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  
	     
	     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the 
jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if 
you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept 
the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to 
building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will 
create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my 
part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  
	     
	     I want now to give the people who are here with me on 
the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the 
American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished 
Attorney General.
  
	     
	     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * 
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that 
the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over 
the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional 
dialogue?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --
they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, 
I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's 
a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- 
people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden 
of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly 
many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the 
strength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision 
that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general 
tax.
	     
	     Q	  Do you personally believe that the American public 
is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I 
mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I 
will say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the 
benefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --
everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you 
streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that 
there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or 
over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive 
care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows 
absolutely massive savings to the health care system.
	     
	     The real question is whether you can transfer those 
savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have 
virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I 
have no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is 
the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, 
they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an 
affordable health care system.
	     
	     But I don't think that has anything to do with this 
stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first 
and foremost.  They want that more than anything else.
	     
	     Q	  Now that you've announced your willingness to 
compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of 
your package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer 
jobs is one.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the 
highway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let 
me say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime 
bill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a 
supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think 
we need to do that.
	     
	     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the 
enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately 
and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people 
with AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be 
done.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the 
safety of the public depends on that.  
	     
	     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I 
don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator 
Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole 
called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call 
him back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we 
discussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said 
that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at 
least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could 
reach some accord.  
	     
	     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been 
already, and let's see if they can talk it out.
	     
	     Q	  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator 
Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 
million, that you want that as part of the package?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word 
for Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator 
Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  
But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I 
wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a 
reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even 
more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the 
American people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly 
consistent with that.
	     
	     Thank you.

                                 END3:12 P.M. EDT

The pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me:

""A gram of this dye costs a dollar.
It comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar.
And if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar.""

I.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering
it to you -- the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct
that cost almost nothing intrinsically.

Peter, I'm sure someone out there has a better/easier way to do what you want
to do, but I'll tell you how we do it where I work. We have about 15 Macs
networked together using Appletalk and PhoneNet connectors. To chat we use a
program called 'Broadcast'. With it we can send brief messages to all or
selected machines within the network.

Hope that helps...

This is so typical of homosexuals -- constantly making excuses for
child molesters.

Hi there!

Could some kind soul tell me what is the price of LC/IIvi/IIvx
compatible 512kb VRAM SIMMs in the US nowadays? The price over here
(Finland) is so ridiculously high (about $185 each in USD) that I
think it is worth the trouble to try to get them overseas.

Thanks

...continued from PART A:

The six of them left. They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-
ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the 
physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had 
an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas
ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this 
went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and 
was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into
tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .

Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I 
want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am 
silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling
me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the
one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, 
telling him, ""I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring 
her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse."" He went and returned empty
handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his 
apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were 
walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. 
There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.

They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I 
went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the
apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be 
cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the 
doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, 
opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle 
Sabir's son started to shout, ""Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!"" He 
knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. 
Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their 
apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying
delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.
All of my family had gathered there.
   
At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the
apartment.

Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, ""Lyuda, 
Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes 
you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful."" It was as though
her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one 
side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her 
cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole
microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, ""Fine."" Mamma was 
afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started 
to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the
bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye 
that was intact, looked at me, and said, ""Who is it?"" But I could barely talk, 
my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something
tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, ""My Karochka, my Karina, my 
little golden one . . . "" She understood me.

Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. 
She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't 
understand it. Then I made out, ""It hurts, I hurt all over."" Her hair was 
glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her 
forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how 
to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's
saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil 
and paper and says, ""Write it down."" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I 
can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me 
something, but she couldn't. I say, ""Karina, just lie there a little while,
then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then."" And then she says,
""Maybe it'll be too late."" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't
control myself.

Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped
a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She 
says, ""Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this 
damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need
to call Urshan."" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I 
understood her every word. I ask, ""What's his number?"" Urshan Feyruzovich, 
that's the head of the administration where she works. ""We have to call him."" 
But I didn't know his home number. I say, ""Karina, what's his number?"" She 
says, ""I can't remember."" I say, ""Who knows his number? Who can I call?"" She 
says, ""I don't know anything, leave me alone.""

I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was 
crying, too. I say, ""Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can 
we call him? Who knows his telephone number?"" I tell Marina, ""Think, think, 
who can we call to find out?"" She started calling; several people didn't 
answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and 
found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he 
was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, 
""Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and 
tell them that they just can't do that."" She still didn't know what was really
going on. I said, ""It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's 
happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single 
Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised 
that we managed to save ourselves. ""She says, ""Well, OK, if it's that serious 
. . . "" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up 
and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. ""OK, 
fine, fine,"" she says, ""if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back 
I'll send him over.""

We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly 
under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She 
wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed 
everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on
trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and 
finally we get through. She says, ""Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your 
place now."" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, 
because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep 
with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what 
shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has 
grown up daughters, they're almost my age.

The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and
went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, 
first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As
soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said
that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have
fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the
first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around
eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I 
saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies
. . . everything just like a war.

They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical
people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older 
Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud 
she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle 
Arkady, I think, because someone said ""Arkady, get an injection ready,"" he 
started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But 
when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his 
sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and 
started to cry: ""What have they done to you?!"" He was speaking Armenian. ""What
have they done to you?!"" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and 
she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. ""I'll give you a shot."" 
Mamma tells him, ""I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what 
are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,
and you're just sitting here!"" Some teacups were standing on the table in 
there. ""You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my 
daughters! Look what they've turned them into!"" They gave her something to 
drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the
doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa 
and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina 
out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I 
don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: ""What's 
the matter with you?"" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter
in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.
I said, ""I'm fine."" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told 
the doctor, ""You leave, let a woman examine her."" A woman came, an 
Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, ""What's wrong with you?"" I was wearing my 
sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When 
she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would 
be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed
her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge 
wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said 
something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be 
dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.

They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. 
I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't 
know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, ""Lie still, you mustn't move."" When
I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed 
very familiar to me. I shouted, ""Stop!"" One of the policemen turned and says, 
""What do you want?"" I say, ""Bring him to me, I want to look at him."" They 
brought him over and I said, ""That person was just in our apartment and he 
just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down."" They said, 
""Fine,"" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were 
taking him.

Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were 
sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car 
up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, ""Sister . . . "" I don't 
remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they
did to us. I asked him, ""Where are you from?"" He said that he was from Ufa. 
Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I 
learned that they suffered most of all. He says, ""OK, you're Armenians, they 
didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,"" he says, ""what are they trying 
to kill me for?"" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the 
balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw 
two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed 
against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him
with his own club. The way he cried ""Mamma"" made my skin crawl. I don't know 
what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before 
he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the
third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was 
Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they
were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with 
someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the 
yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that
I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.

They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too 
and said, ""I've been beaten too, help me."" But they just ignored her. My 
father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault 
that he'd been beaten, and says, ""My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have 
probably broken my ribs. Please look at them."" The doctor says, ""That's not my
job."" Urshan said, ""Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, 
I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them 
to his apartment.

Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the 
doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I 
wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very
surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the
Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--
coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,
having examined Karina, said, ""No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like 
they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.
""Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she
would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same 
story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no 
drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon
found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And
they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at 
zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from 
seeing it.

They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have 
any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their 
place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira 
her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And
Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.
When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she 
involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.
Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful 
when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, ""Do what
you want with me, just leave my daughter alone."" Well, they did what they 
wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I 
would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It 
was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do 
every day: steal, kill, rape . . .

Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts 
explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those 
children would be grown, and then, as they put it, ""we'll come take the 
pleasure out of their lives, those children."" This was about the girls that
would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow 
because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just
as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be 
of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the 
victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that
they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they
themselves said that.

And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many 
people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know 
why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, 
maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and 
they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at 
nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with 
Marina: ""Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over 
there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman 
shouldn't see such things."" So they were really quite sober . . .

So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all 
happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several 
hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what
happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-
ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he
thought no one is listening: ""Listen,"" he'll say, ""what could I do? What could
I do alone, how could I protect them?"" I don't know where to find the words,
it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. 
That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of 
course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail
of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke
together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never
present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And
when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.

On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.
First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, 
the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. 
There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family 
there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They 
were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife 
and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.

Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.
There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.
They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought
that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become
so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.
The women were shouting. They explained to them: ""We want to hide you
better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.""

We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We
had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to 
have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. 
They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you 
could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the 
police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is 
surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were 
standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought 
great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't 
just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,
or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost 
family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened 
when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single
person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must
have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret 
room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at
one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those 
people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that
the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the 
hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my 
parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should 
attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an 
Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and 
she wouldn't be able to take it.

Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people 
climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.
They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We 
calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some 
little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children
to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never 
have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people 
do eat.

Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They 
were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from 
the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a 
different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, 
and calling out: ""Oh, Rafik!,"" but when she heard about this such a rage came 
over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her 
sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were 
soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were
standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up
to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash 
him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not 
one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from 
doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, 
muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile
appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round
was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing 
terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the 
creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did 
this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She 
went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, 
""What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they 
raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though 
nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?"" She appealed to everyone, but no 
one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I 
could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so 
many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already
after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the 
elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. 
There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. 
The situation was deplorable.

At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, 
Azerbaijanis. They said, ""Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up
and put the children to bed."" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, 
either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with 
dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, ""Oh, it's our little 
family,"" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for 
the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone
spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded
machine guns in their hands, said, ""Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,
I'm on guard."" Our people would say, ""Oh, that's all right."" They hugged
them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly
moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.

They took us up to the second floor and said, ""You can undress and sleep in 
here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.""
This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other
places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the
SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I 
asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.
I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, ""Don't worry, the
Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest
assured. I say, ""Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in
there is capable of anything.""

When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had
already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-
tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once
we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met 
acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who 
hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with 
them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had 
come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like 
they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, 
hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of 
course the stories and the talk were flying: ""Oh, I heard that they killed 
him!"" ""What do you mean they killed him!"" ""He stayed at work!"" ""Do you know 
what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.

And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very 
well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small 
room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night 
talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary 
of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see 
Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed 
from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask 
him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by 
soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with 
the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.

Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, ""Lyudochka, find another 
two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, 
lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people 
who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned."" I 
had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, ""Lyuda, your 
Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are 
alive and well and that you're here."" I gave the lists to someone and asked 
them to continue what I was doing and went off.

The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's
father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels
Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the 
name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said 
that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front
of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later 
it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had
somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for 
Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that 
in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored 
missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3

All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were 
contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple 
of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, ""What's 
going on?"" He said, ""Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels
they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev
[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to
him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it
was one or fifty."" They told him that the list had disappeared and they
should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over
again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26
was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because
that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 
people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only 
a half of those that were on the first list. He said, ""Lyuda, please, try to
remember at least one more."" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there
were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy
don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people 
whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of
the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many 
people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns
in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the 
Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that 
there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical 
Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk 
cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went 
to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering
the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the 
Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's
more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list 
drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course
don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to 
publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, 
they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them
is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. 
8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know 
her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in 
Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the 
same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding 
the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and 
when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her 
braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because 
they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one 
. . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.

They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for
days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there 
and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; 
it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could 
already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the 
social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, 
""If it weren't for the work I would go insane."" He and I put ourselves in gear
and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers 
and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, 
although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been 
dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it 
was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by
to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly
visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.

On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir
Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered 
only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.
Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.

Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I 
told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and
record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. 
We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the
conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor 
quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there 
weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a 
curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or 
video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that 
we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially 
to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw
that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to 
Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with 
Bibishev, I told him myself, ""Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two 
months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in
those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.""

He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I
gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to
her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-
self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-
rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat
and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we
were in Baku already, the investigator told me, ""How long can you go on like 
this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're
not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this
investigation through. We need you."" Then I started eating, because in fact I
was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-
ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement
cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in
every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of
Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary 
confinement.

Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma 
identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify 
anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the 
photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one 
who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the 
loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know 
his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his 
sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that 
even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will 
continue looking for him.

The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various 
plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.
Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only
one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and
Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-
tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front
of me ""I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash
simply for keeping him out of Armenia,"" that is, to keep him from landing in
a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the
investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even
though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological
pressure--they say, ""Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an
Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you
in short order."" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.

The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire
pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then
that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was 
in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and 
all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned 
them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials
from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James 
Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were 
boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had 
been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's 
enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't
even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did 
take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out 
slippers.

Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. 
Basically, the group that went seeking ""revenge""--let's use their word for 
it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with 
one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that 
black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking
part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of 
Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently
arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I 
don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an 
Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know 
nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an 
axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and 
threw them into the tub with water.

I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You 
know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both 
their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-
eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I 
identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born
in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How 
did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I 
kept thinking, is that Rita or ""puma,"" which it would be if you read the word 
as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic ""T"" was the one 
that looks like a Latin ""M."" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind
his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to
put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and 
told me that I was making a mistake, and called me ""dear sister."" He said, 
""You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an 
Armenian,"" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator 
asked me, ""Lyuda, are you sure it was he?"" I told him, ""I'll tell you one more
identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The 
name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand."" He went rigid and became 
pale. They told him, ""Put your hands on the table."" He put his hands on the
table with the palms up. I said, ""Now turn your hands over,"" but he didn't 
turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start
acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they 
forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.
But he insolently stuck to his story, ""No, I did not do anything, it wasn't 
me."" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his
hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew
into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out 
of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. 
Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked
and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and 
back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, 
but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or 
strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the 
microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his
last name, and he says, ""Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .
"" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. 
They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, 
because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, ""You're 
some actress! What a performance!"" I said, ""Tolya, honestly . . . "" Beforehand
they would always tell me, ""Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if 
nothing had happened to you."" I say, ""I don't have any more strength or 
emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength 
. . . I don't have the strength to do anything."" And he says, ""Lyuda, how were
you able to do that?"" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching
the tape, I said, ""Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped 
that high in gym class.""

So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of 
the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who 
beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.

At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his 
guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among
them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, 
""Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three
o'clock."" He said, ""No, I'm not coming."" They told him, ""If you don't come 
we'll kill you."" He said, ""Alright, I'll come."" And he went.

They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He
had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a 
motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him 
out of his apartment and told him the same thing: ""Tomorrow we're going to get
the Armenians. Be there."" He said, ""No."" They pulled a knife on him. He said, 
""I'm not going all the same."" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed 
him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was
in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that 
we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.

I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he
beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he
was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for
him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning
of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our 
apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our 
apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I 
don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked
out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina
because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the
courtyard, he remained in the apartment.

At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her
I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't 
have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third
and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work
with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.

The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't
call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out
someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, ""I don't 
understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head."" But we know that
they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the
name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--
that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.
Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their
level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they
work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they 
crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were 
promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.
So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, ""they 
promised us apartments.""

Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the
heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a 
children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at 
the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they 
have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or 
grandparents. And he said, ""I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how
I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my 
own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing."" And the whole time I
kept repeating, ""Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife 
right before your own eyes."" He sat there and just wailed.

But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a 
marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just 
have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his
grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how 
to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he 
knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed 
himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.

That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr 
Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, ""Let's go, enough, you've spilled
enough blood here.""

Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was 
that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya
and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They 
liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When 
Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors 
old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to 
the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were 
already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back
and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have 
sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older 
woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of 
Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.
The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands 
and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, 
he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.

There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first 
floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a
custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.
But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is 
tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.

Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we 
have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these 
events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come 
about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that 
without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not 
have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,
let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their 
nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are 
a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for
what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like
unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they 
threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,
to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on
February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone 
who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left
for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got
as far away as their legs would carry them.

February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came 
into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had 
been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for 
a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few 
teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or 
seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there 
were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the 
evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and 
the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the 
microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the 
driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani
child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had
seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: ""Death to the Armenians! They must
be killed!"" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because 
people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The 
woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians 
cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, ""Sons, avenge my daughters!"" That 
was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the 
direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.

We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a 
very nationalist speech. He said, ""Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!"" This 
he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him 
stormily, whistling and shouting ""Karabagh!"" He said, ""Karabagh has been our 
territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my 
heart?"" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. ""It's our 
territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. 
From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from
time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years 
the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth."" By filth he meant 
Armenians.

I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.
Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with 
the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,
that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our
teachers said, ""Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's 
spouting,"" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we 
listened to the woman's speech.

Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the 
subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of
studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I
had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to 
obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,
""Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If 
they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I 
tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?"" When he 
said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a 
second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already
after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, 
""No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until 
twelve. Stay here."" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in 
kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: ""I left my 
children at the kindergarten."" The director excused her. When she let her go I
turned around, said, ""Good-bye,"" and left with the young teacher, the 
Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.

When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran
nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too 
much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed 
off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher 
wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.

To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at 
the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and
again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched 
television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last 
day. That's how it all was.

At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,
Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store 
on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she 
doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father 
held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the 
ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went 
out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the 
entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders 
there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the 
moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been 
injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, 
and their children: any way they could. 

Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, 
Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims 
what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one 
another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even 
with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and 
their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got 
them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked 
electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then 
they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an 
Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director
and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to 
escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of 
course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only
thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The 
Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored 
personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and
led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored 
personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that 
very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.

I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, 
strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a 
strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.

One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking 
for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, 
people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps 
dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went 
with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found 
Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and 
put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or 
infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the 
neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject 
came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the 
basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor
carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing 
as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor 
took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything 
seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing 
of ours he had managed to ""save.""

Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended 
themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were
Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some 
reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just 
victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. 
In the TV show ""Pozitsiya"" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that 
the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not 
important, the truth will come out regardless.

So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our 
bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the 
years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've 
become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.

On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said
that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments
received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans 
will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the 
Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-
tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on 
the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear
speaking our native tongue.

	There is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that.
It is by Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu).  It takes a sun 3 and
boots a limited kernel which allows you to run X.  We converted 4
machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
-- I find them faster than an NCD 15inch black&white XTerminal that we
are playing with, and a bigger screen to boot!  As a matter of fact,
the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert!

} Xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ctr.columbia.edu
} [128.59.64.40] in /Xkernel/Xkernel.shar (/Xkernel is a symlink to the
} latest version of Xkernel)

	Note that the compiled version which is available is for the
sun 3/50, but compiling to work for a sun 3/1xx should be quite easy.

	I am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
installer and user 8).  I may be able to answer questions; feel free
to email me.

    Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles
on your electronic odometer with an oscillator....

    I wouldn't expect to be able to do this.  Not because the engineers at BMW are
putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile
environment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative.

   If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program,
it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):

         * Debouncing/deglitching  ( Is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? )
         * Smoothing:  The rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:
                                This is a car, not an electron.
         *  Top speed limit:  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous: must be
                                        electrical noise or contact bounce

    As for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out of
a BMW dashboard, I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the
middle of the card.  Good luck getting at the counter :-).

    I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it's
probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.  After all,
a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics;  there used to be an
app note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into this
in good detail.

Lines: 33
NNTP-Posting-Host: 140.239.3.202

Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination, this is
driving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do.

I need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is
merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy -- allowing me an
additional resource name level.

To illustrate I have an application with the following widget
heirarchy:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Application Widghet

I want the following:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Intermediate Widget
	         |
	 Application Widget

where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other
properties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget.

I assume there's a simple way to do this but I can't find an example
and the documentation I have is rather vague about implementing
composite widgets.

Please respond via email.  Any help will be very much appreciated.

The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reason
to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep 
in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.
This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless
you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the
LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most
people and has a great price.

If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs.
16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again.

Exactly why science uses mathematics. QM representation in natural language
is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical
terminology. Nor is it supposed to be the truth, as opposed to the
representation of gods or religions in ordinary language. Admittedly,
not  every religion says so, but a fancy side effect of their inept
representations are the eternal hassles between religions.
 
And QM allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will
be agreed upon as being similar. Show me something similar in religion.

With the effect that the models presented are useless. And one can argue
that the other way around, namely that the only reason metaphysics still
flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified -
showing that it is bogus.

No.

In what still, IMHO, ranks as the all-time greatest PR blunder (not to
mention on-ice blunder) the Whalers ever committed, GM Eddie Johnston and
Coach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
him of the Captain's ""C"" in December of 1990. The whole organization (read:
EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of
a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all
season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly 
humiliating him, stripping him of the ""C"", and then trading him that Spring
to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.

The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of
decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness
from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.

[Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it
acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the
roster but he DID lay a foundation.]

Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer
themselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the
tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and
not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously
suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??

Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include
countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,
from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him
at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,
but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was 
right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since
then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But
that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that
it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
or better as a result, is absurd.

Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at
the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.
And that was my original point.

Several years ago I tried to commit a patient who was growing Salmonella out of his
stool, blood, and an open ulcer for treatment. The idea was that the guy was a
walking public health risk, and that forcing him to receive IV antibiotics for
a few days was in the public interest. I will make a long story short by saying
that the judge laughed at my idea, yelled at me for wasting his time, and let
the guy go.

I found out that tuberculosis appears to be the only MEDICAL (as oppsed to psychiatric)

Subject: Need help with video detection circuit
Organization: Systems'n'Software
Lines: 55



I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.
a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics
card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)
and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be
cheap.  

My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each
compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input
went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).

The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my
circuit would not detect it.   

The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work.  

There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require 
split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator
with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply
circuit.  

At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor
circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...

Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any
ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly
appreciated.  

Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so
I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a
way to take advantage of that fact.

Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,
you will have my undying gratitude.

             The Lunar Tele-operation Model One (LTM1)
             =========================================
                        By David H. Mitchell
                          March 23, 1993
 
INTRODUCTION:
 
In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a
real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test
tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals
located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment
purposes.
Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and
tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of
information
on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of
a
lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating
educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and
achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in
Twenty-First century remote learning methods.
 
Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests
and
skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,
interfacing
and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving
playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and
professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at
a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at
the
LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real
facility
exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the
construction
of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested
by the users themselves.
 
This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:
 - tele-operations and virtual reality research
 - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation
 - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers
 - art and theater
 - bbs and online network users
 - software and game developers
 - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains
 - children
 - the child in all of us
 
LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:
 
A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used
for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.
The ""floor"" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions
is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and
creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and
machine-lets.
 
 The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:
 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;
 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and
 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.
 
 Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on
 it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture
 content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent
 to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.
 
The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains
with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control
electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will
receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their
data link to LTM1.
 
Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a
servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the
SSTO
to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar
landscape and land.
 
Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped
bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators
worldwide
to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and
takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on
commercially
available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the
interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced
ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.
 
By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding
a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be
provided in under 80 man hours.
 
PLAN OF ACTION:
 
The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by
providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network.
Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction
of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be
modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide ""rail stock""
for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical
communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.
An initial ""ground breaking"" with miniature shovels will be performed for
a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial
models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for
historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely
serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional
building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and
the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution
world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be
issued
calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale
models
for the simulated lunar colony.
 
A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then
be
announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to
find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of
the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that
time
the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will
then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return
to
their campus.
 
A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via
conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment
addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.
Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo
opportunity for the television community. Especially since the ""action""
will
be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be
invited to issue ""challenges"" to engineering and human factors students at
universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform
lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be
simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.
 
The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,
experimentation
and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a
long
term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic
example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited
to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can
lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!
 
CONCLUSION:
 
EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has
ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a
globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation
purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create
world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require
real
(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in
space.

The idea of the U.S, or any other nation, taking action, i.e., military
intervention, in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who 
advocate such action. After the belligerants are subdued, it would require
an occupation force for one or two generations. If you will stop and
think about it, you will realize that these people have never forgotten
a single slight or injury, they have imbibed hatred with their mother's
milk. If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will
simply go back to killing each other with clubs. And the price for this
futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to
die. A price I am unwilling to even consider.

There is no valid comparison to the Holocaust. All of the Jewish people
that I have known as friends were not brought up to hate. To be wary of
others, most certainly, but not to hate. And except for the Warsaw
uprising, they were unarmed (and even in Warsaw badly out-gunned).
It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's muscles.
Suppose we do this thing, what will you tell the parents, wives, children,
lovers of those we are sending to die? That they gave their lives in some noble cause? Noble cause, separating some mad dogs who will turn on them.

Well, I will offer you some muscle. Suppose we tell them that they have
one week (this will give foreign nationals time to leave) to cease
their bloodshed. At the end of that week, bring in the Tomahawk firing
ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities. Perhaps
when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden
attack of brains. Send in missiles by all means, but do not send in
troops.

Only Brendan McKay, or maybe ARF, would come to the rescue of Nazi
racial theory.  Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any
eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks
of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire ""problem""
as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East,
and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of
his ""even-handed"" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what 
he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine:
rectification of the ""abnormal presence"" of the Jewish people within a 
larger body politic.  Whether your ""solution"" involves gas, monetary 
incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has 
said, ""disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal 
surrounding Arab culture,"" you are engaged in a Nazi project.

Just as obvious is your statement: ""I will not comment on the value
or lack of value of Elias's proposal.""  Still striking the glancing
blow, right Brendan?  You could easily see where he was going, but you
""will not comment.""  So, you are complicitous.

What is your fascination with Nazi racial theory, anyway?

Hi all,
I am looking into methods I can use to turn my Linux based BBS into a full color
Graphical BBS that supports PC, Mac, Linux, and Amiga callers. 
Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard (a summary of 
which hit this group about 2 weeks ago). 
Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find
that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being
PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full
commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldn't)

Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC, Mac, Amiga. I know there
is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7
But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.

Is there a color version of MGR for Linux? 
I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it.

Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ?
I can't seem to send a message to the MGR channel without it bouncing.

Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ?

Thanks in advan

	I wondered the same thing.  But giving Joe the benefit of the

	he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his
	speed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely

	Well, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing

	Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm
	going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's
	got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - 
	coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign 
	in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  
	It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin 
	was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  
	BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third 
	and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the 
	replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a 
	serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year 
	and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.

The investment was there in the form of huge tax breaks, and employer
benfits.  You are overlooking the difference that these could have
made to any company.  Part of the problem was that few industries
were interested in political settling, as much as profit.

True, which leads to the obvious question, should any investment have
been made there at the taxpayer's expense.  Obviously, the answer was
and still is a resounding no.

	Harumph. Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something
to aspire to. :-)
	I can't really argue with your logic, though I think you may be
extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of
one. Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is
not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who
treat Lyme disease.
	By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who
consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to
Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe
they are encouraging good medicine. I have no idea how sincere these guys
are, but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for
what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment.
	I would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issues
in Lyme, rather than speculating as to the motives of the various parties
involved.

I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman's account of the
software-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically
correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking
care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited
the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He
also noted that the software people were starting to feel management
pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)

Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things
right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure
during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.
As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted
on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.

As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.
Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the
experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.
(None of the experimenters could afford it.)

You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap
(XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set.  What you want
to do is start your application with your new colormap.  This can be a
chicken and egg sort of problem, however.  If you look at the Xt FAQ
there is an example that should show how it can be done.  If not, let
me know and maybe I can improve the example.

Which Jews KS?

American, perhaps, but nothing military about it.  I learned (mostly)
slugs when we talked English units in high school physics and while

Yes, I am pro-gun, and yes, I do disagree with this statement.
Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous.  Radioactive
decay of plutonium and uranium, as well as the tritium in the
weapon, tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things.
(Can you say ""neutron flux""?)  Plus these things have no self-
defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as
a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use
(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration
(translation:  cities and population centers).  Not to mention that
for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live
requires some sort of launch vehicle . . .

You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
doesn't see it right away...Valentine is the best detector by far (as stated
by Car and Driver) and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from.
 It also gives the amount of ""threats"" it is picking up, so if you go through
 the same place everyday, and it always goes off there, you can glance at the
 number of ""threats"" the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop.
  It's about $300 and you can only get it factory direct..one problem.

There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC
processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is 
not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to
swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications.
As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between
a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.

This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors, Intel has 
certainly proved that.

What I want to know, is what does this have to do with this group?

Maybe 300 such pairs suffice to reconstruct S1 and S2? By such a back-
door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for  
the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in 
one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the 
keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U) 
pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant 
for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they 
have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)

And I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ... 
Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the 
production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each, 
plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular, 
Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting, 
divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the 
private sector anyway. 

And let me mention one other thought that certainly has occurred to all 
the notoriously paranoid people in this group before: Who is going to 
verify that _no_ interested party will perform tempest attacks on the 
vault??

There is a certain truth to this statement. Only I would use the word
""medicine"" instead of drug.  With regard to the condition of the human
soul, Christianity is first and foremost a healing medicine.  It also
strengthens and enables one, as healing takes hold, to grow in new
strength and health to live and be and to do that for which God created 
us.

> Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  

Christ's medicine, rightly allowed to work, brings one nearer to
reality and offers the clarity of understanding and the strength
of spirit with which to meet it in a healthy human way.

  The event that had the most impact on Gaetti's career was his leg injury
in 1988.  His performance dropped radically from 1988 to 1989.  He was 
still with the Twins in 1989 and 1990, but if you look at his stats (both

These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a
direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable.
Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in the
age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There is
repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And not just
for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew and Gentile
alike.

A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the
plane (it may require you to give it a ""cut"" though...)

E.g., a cylinder, a cone, a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch
having vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e., with singular
Hessian, the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch)
are ""developable"". In more technical words, a developable surface is
""locally isometric to a plane"" at all points.


Think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable:
whatever way(s) you cut it, you will not be able to lay flat any pieces
of it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).

For more details on this look at any book on differential geometry
which treats surfaces (2D manifolds); e.g., M. do Carmo's book:

@Book{Carmo76Differential,
  author =      {do Carmo, Manfredo P.},
  title =       {Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces},
  year =        1976,

There usually is a way, however, often, telephone companies like to
keep all of their internal numbers private. Depends on your exchange.
Any modern electronic switching equipment usually have voice synth
lines that echo the number you called from. The line service guys use this
to make sure they connect up the right pairs of lines.

       Texas is unusual in this regard.  It would be nice to reduce them

       As Texas doesn't appear to have an murder rate that much higher than

       Here's where we run into a problem.  I am perfectly willing to
have government regulation on something which is likely to cause others
harm.  What we're discussing, though, is the extreme regulation of a large
group in order to target a small group, and I don't think that's
appropriate.

        Does this, then, justify anything?  At some point you have to draw
a line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have
something a little more substantial than a set of percentages with which
to punish an individual.

        Where do *you* draw the line?  Or is there one?

        Cute analogy. 

        The U.S. doesn't treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However,
we also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate
*all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal
system that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property
confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual.
That is, it isn't enough to show that the majority of people convicted of
murder are white  in order to convict a particular white guy of murder.

First,Happy Birthday,Val. Second, ESPN's affinity with Patrick has probably
more to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week NHN(National Hockey
Night) affair.(ESPN-ABC owner,Capital Cities, is a company known for being
quite thrifty with minimal overhead costs. It's quite possible that Jim
Schoenfeld may be working for doughnuts :-).

Gary Thorne and Bill Clement are both NJ-based and the rest of ESPN crew
resides in the suburban CT with a very close proximity to tri-state area.
Plus,it makes sense in terms of solid hockey following in the NorthEast

Actually I favor government funded research. It *is* a pump prime
for a lot of basic technologies. I also understand the short term
value of high tech welfare programs. But they can't substitute for
long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise. That's what's
needed to maintain a healthy economy *anywhere*, on Earth or Luna.
I don't see that long term potential on Luna due to a bunch of
factors I outline in another post.

It is obvious that Mr. Cramer has the 'ability' to take the 'leap of faith'.
I have listened to several of the men involved in this study, and even they
claim that the men involved will not 'tell the whole truth'.

I put little value in extrapolating from these types of 'studies' or 'surveys',
they have limited subsets of individuals, and there is alot of skewing due
to improper selection methods, and the bias of the people involved in the
studies on both sides- subject and researcher.

Would you admit to be part of a group that was not very well liked?  Would 
you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormal
rate (this applies to heterosexual men).  In fact, as one gay man and one
straight man put it, ""men lie about the number of partners, because that's
the thing to do""- our culture for the male almost requires this type of
response.  It may seem harmless and silly, but carries a large emotional
and mental price tag.

I hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed' 
conquest.  They just have to look good to one another, at least in their
eyes.  But also know that alot of this does go on, there are many college
males (hetero) having a lot of sex with different partners.

You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put
it at a convenient number like ""1"".  You *could* cut a hole in the
back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the
hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of
your internal drive.

Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned
too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine
with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM
SIMMs, though.

You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple
dealer.  The relevant parts are:

  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate
  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25"" device mounting bracket]

Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to
mount a 5.25"" device.  The service techs I talked to said, ""Oh sure,
we stock those.""  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to
hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.

As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already
cut out for a standard 5.25"" device.  (Why not?  They advertise
these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the
5.25"" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for
their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.

I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my
tape drive, which is a standard 5.25"" device.

Good luck with your SyQuest.

This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this, but never mind.
Any machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,  
thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference  
between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of  
the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  
of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  
oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  
the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  
steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  
something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  
type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  
unobjectionable). Got it ?

today designed to preserve the government organism at the expense
of individuals.  Look around and reread 1984 and many early
Heinlein books.  Aren't there many parallels between the thought
police (can you spell Waco Texas?), and Heinlein's ``Crazy Years''?

If you can get it, you might want to try a Canadian over-the-counter product
called Secaris, which is a water-soluble gel.  Compared to Vaseline or other
greasy ointments, Secaris seems more compatible with the moisture that's
already there.

Hey, it's better than the status quo.

I am far less worried about ""the feds"" tapping my phone than high school 
scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
cordless phone calls.

It would be stupid to rely on even a ""Clipperized"" channel for truly 
sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to 
guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong ""right 
to bear arms"" view of the private right to possess and use strong 
cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would 
actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular 
phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market 
voice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.

If you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS 
for electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key 
exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.

And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at 
least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...

Is clear coat really worth it?  Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars
have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs
that aren't clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clear
coated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has
fine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.

Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed.
When I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember
from a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car
to the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my
car.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof
(which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before
he dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a
haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light
hits the roof at a particular angle.

I am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any 
chance of getting the dealership to do something about this?
My guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that provides
a solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect of
having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches?
Information, commiseration, and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .

I apologize to the moderator, but the first quote was deleted and I
would like to respond to both.

As for the ""goal we can never achieve"", the reward comes from the
trying.  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for
the prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the
commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.
As it says in 1 John 5:3:  ""This is love for God:  to obey his comands.""
That obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this
requires work on our part.

As for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What
matters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in
what one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to
oneself about believing in the first place.  

Stan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by
obligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how
many times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when
doing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we
should do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel
Jesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to
Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  ""Preach the Word; be prepared in season and
out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and
careful instruction.""  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1
Timothy 4:16:  ""Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in
them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.""
So, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are
correct first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be
hypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be
a disciple completely in both thought and deed.

Subject: prayers and advice requested on family problem
Organization: Princeton University

My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after
his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago.
We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level
for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with
his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined
slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll
happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've
seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep
the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact
with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his
choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.
   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a
relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful
relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, ""Why
be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse
to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to
come back."" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on
with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I
could think of.
   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going
to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the
outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and
raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and
in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was
beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the
allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not
quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their
relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung
up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is
the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if
she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the
break out in the open and done with.
 
    I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;
angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for
persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their
children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my
brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us
that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to
appease an unappeasable,
emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;
scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will
change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-
righteous over this bit of proof that they can't ""get away"" with treating
us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even
beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,
sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in
a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or
they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated
because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me
up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence,
and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not
free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO*
something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting
vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal
mental chatter enough to listen for God.)
  Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is
this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I
conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?
 
Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long
post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and
charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on
my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him
and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or
post.
 
Thank you.

Mornin' all.  I was wonderin'.....
I got screenpeace (the screensaver, which I think is *very*
good), and I got a problem with it...
There is an option there, ""realize colour table"", and if it's
switched on, some wallpapers' colours will get *ucked up with
some screensavers (e.g. the ""flashlight"" one).  If I turn it off,
however, it works well, and it's faster, so I have it off.  All's
nice and well.  However, If I turn it off, then it will be on
again next time I start windows.  All the setting are set in the
win.ini file, and I *do* have ""save settings on exit"" selected.

also, I tried manually changing the setting in the win.ini file
to ""n"" (for no-->realize colour table), and started windows.  It
will be fine for that session, but the next session will *again*
turn the option on.

I tried adding a +R (read-only) attribute to my win.ini file, and
it worked, but my bitmap (wallpaper) saver didn't work then.
Actually, it's the same application.  Anywya, it didn't work,
since it must change the setting at the win.ini file.

so anyone out there got any answers/suggesions/comments for me?

Undoubtedly.  In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete
for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and 
undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.

>Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech, high-price 
>machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges.

Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney
dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services
to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.
Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the
vast expansion that has occurred.

Can you spell ""loss leader?""  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not
attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of
it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader 
for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  

But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that
price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of
service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide 
comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply
make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had 
risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.

There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD 
substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday
predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction
of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears
that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers 
are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  
(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to
Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  

The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government 
intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial
results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that ""government
bureaucracy"" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace
should take such such cases into account.

I never thought I'd contribute to a Gateway thread, either pro or con, but
my spleen could use a little venting.  The scenario:

	1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller
	2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy)
	3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy)
	4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days 
		(getting happier)
	5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again)
	6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days
			(cooling off, the end is in sight)
	7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad
		(VERY unhappy)

Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)
	and have on-site service install it for me.
BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people
only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours
with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$
to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and
I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole 
thing is going back.  
  I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me
that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also
the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke
to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything
up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.

I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the
prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support
again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm
beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.
Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is
booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again.
Oh well, I feel better now...

The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works
*exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.  If it says XC, that means
there is at least one known bug.  Often these bugs are small and obscure;
you might never run into them in practice.

At least Motorola admits it, unlike certain other companies...

Why do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father ""to let this cup
pass from Him"", was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at
Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the
presense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every
detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But
as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His
presense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it
was brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of
Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no
avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not
only then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of
Jesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical
portion was only the tip of the iceburg.

BTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly
king.  From John:

JOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they
            began to say, ""Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the
            world.""
JOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by
            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.

This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an
earthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &
Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those
who would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's
dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew
what His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the
darkness of His Passion.

This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing
layers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.
Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner
compacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or
delaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years
following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose
up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have
a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.

Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and
other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the
comfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously
degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of
""parking your lid"" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the
comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly
damaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.

I am trying to build a resource allocation program for managing a

I need to get the translation into English (when there is one) of the
following words. They refer to medical categories of operating rooms
(theaters). I admit they may not be universally ""used"".

1- sceptique

If we do, I think you'd loose.  Sure, you're hand's already on the
throttle.  And your thumb is already near the horn button.  Pushing the
horn button is one simple move.  Revving the throttle requires either
engaging the clutch, or accelerating.  The first is a more complex
manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright
when there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides, the unique sound of a
horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than
is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are
on the road!).

As is usually the case, a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
safety procedure.

The answer is 161.33 feet.

Not necessarily --- they could release the details of the algorithm
without releasing the ""system key"" (called SK by Hellman).  That would
make most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedure
before key exchange, the ""official"" chips would only work with other
""official"" chips.  In other words, secrecy of SK makes ""physically
identical clone versions"" impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't
be necessary.

Of course, revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK ---
since all units share this key, compromising it may be a big deal.
Personally, I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one ""secret""
80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security.
Of course, compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system
is compromised, but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true
with a secret algorithm.

Incidentally, what's to keep a ""secret algorithm"" from using the secret
SK as the main key, with UK being only marginally important.  Then
a court order for UK may not even be necessary to do a wiretap.

I use the Diamond SpeedStar 24X in 1024X768X256 mode all of the time.  I 
have NOT found distortions in the cursor.  The cursor is a little jumpy 
from time to time (due to 32 bit access to the swap file), but it is never

Joe, just 'cause you say they aren't subject to interpretation doesn't
necesarily make it so.  That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.

> They are 2 Peter 1:20-21, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, and

2 Peter 1:20-21
But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter 
of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of
human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.

The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20.
Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.

2 Timothy 3:16-17
All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for
reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of
God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.

Galations 1:11-12
For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man, 
nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus
Christ.

When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what
every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible
connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been,
wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the 
same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your 
are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing 
I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that 
our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.

In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to
any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and
understanding Scripture.  If interpretation is unnecessary, there are 
an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time 
and energy on it.

I saw the replay several times too.  No question about it.  Daryl missed
the ball, *then* the fan caught it.  Daryl is so tall that he had the
first shot at the ball.  Daryl's just whining again.  I think it shows a
lack of class when Tommy, Daryl and the Dodgers blame a single fan for
losing the game.  What about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball?
What about the pitchers that gave up 6 runs up to that point?  Sorry, Tommy.
If it were a 2-1 game and Daryl was 5 feet 2 inches tall, then maybe -
just maybe - you'd have an argument.

Actually, that is no longer true. In the last few years Congress has

Could be. There is a Jayson Stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate

Stark has done this sort of thing, but he has never been serious about it.
He usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of 
such columns. I think he did it one season and some manager was ""projected"" 
to be thrown out of 60 games and some hitter could expect to be plunked 
150 times.

Stark does some really funny stuff. His weekly baseball reviews are good 
collections of strange things that happened during the previous week. He 
also regularly prints Kinerisms.

Subject: Fighting the Clipper Initiative
Summary: Ways to fight it 
Organization: Climate and Global Dynamics Division/NCAR, Boulder, CO
Lines: 71

Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White
House Clipper chip crypto initiative.  I think this is going to be a
tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of
resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are
serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate
Bill 266 in 1991.

Possible actions to take in response:

1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and
more.

2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and
technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,
write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or
newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. 
Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be
slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and
arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming
libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. 

3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your
Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US
Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of
technology issues.  Talk to those aides.

4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party
would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of
the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a
surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political
spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other
activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government
that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play
themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you
want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.

4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming
these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal
expenses and lobbying.

5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably
develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be
lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a
telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your
coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then
present your company's management with a united front of engineering
talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your
management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold
meetings on it.

6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla
techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,
anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,
etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might
also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed
by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful
tools for these purposes. 

7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on
this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we
may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't
outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of
this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to
analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it
modified.

  Lev 17:11: For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given
  it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is
  the blood that makes atonement for the soul.

The Old Testament was very big on the ""eye for an eye"" business.  It
makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to ""repay""
moral wrongdoing.

I know about sanctification.  I've been taught all about it in Sunday
school, catechism class, and theology classes.  But even after all
that, I still can't accept it.  Maybe I'm still not understanding it,
or maybe I'm just understanding it all too well.

From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent
man is wrong.  I've tried repeatedly over the course of several years
to accept it, but I just can't.  If this means that I can't accept the
premise that a god who would allow this is 'perfectly good', then so
be it.

If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a *good* thing,
then I would be very glad to hear it, and you might even convert me.
Be warned, however, that I've heard all the most common arguments
before, and they just don't convince me.

[AFS]     Just a quick comment::
[AFS]
[AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians.
[AFS]
[AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?

Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was 
quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi 
revisionists say!

[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in
[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)
[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.
[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were 
[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy 
[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not 
[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.

OK.

[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my
[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these 
[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe 
[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,
[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...

There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the
Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-
Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever 
killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of
Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-
Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after
the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the
extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died
in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of
preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish 
genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers
away!

[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people
[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',
[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed
[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these 
[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. 

I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.

[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,
[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.
[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some
[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.
[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish
[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with
[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately
[SY] very easy to start a fire!

Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to
do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that
the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through 
Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians 
militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of
Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement 
caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years 
earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> 
Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> 
Massachusetts. 

[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience
[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were
[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to
[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves
[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.

My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste
potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian
young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,
local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive 
today.

[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.
[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But
[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why 
[SY] should they become enemies?

It also falls within the purview of the ACLU, but that doesn't mean
the ACLU (or the EFF) would be the most effective instrument to 
""win the hearts and minds"" in favor of access to cryptography. 

It's precisely slogans like ""cryptography makes censorship impossible""
which stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor
of encryption.  It is not true, and in the context of a public debate it
would be a dangerous red herring.  Advocates of strong crypto had better
prepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople
and politicians can sympathize with. The usual mumblings about
Constitutional amendments are not enough.
